    "text": "<b>Prerequisite: </b>You must be trained in Diplomacy. The games of court are about winning allies and subtle persuasion, which is impossible without at least some knowledge of the art of diplomacy.  Most adventurers stick out like a troll among halflings when placed in courtly situations. They see only a bunch of nobles and retainers fawning over one another in incomprehensible ways with little relevance to their lives. A courtier knows better. A battle rages amid the smiles and niceties of court. Each word is a carefully calculated move, each meeting a play for political power, and each friend another piece in the game of court. A single mistake can mean the difference between acquiring a powerful position and being clapped in irons. A courtier sees unique solutions to a problem. When confronted by a wicked duke, a typical adventurer might launch an assault on his keep or try to assassinate him. A courtier might instead go to the king and plant the idea that the dukeâ€™s wicked acts are a political liability. The villainous duke could soon be stripped of his lands and titles, thus ending his threat just as effectively. ",
