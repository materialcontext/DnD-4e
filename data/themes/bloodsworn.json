For bloodsworn, though, guarding against wickedness is not enough. They take the fight to their enemies in a quest to destroy them all.  Evil creates the situation that brings a bloodsworn into existence. Some terrible event sows the seeds of vengeance in an individual’s heart, goading him or her to take up sword and staff to fight back against the darkness and ensure that evil never rears its head again. Often, bloodsworn are survivors of slaughters, whether from goblin marauding, a dark cult’s sacrifices, or grimlock raids. Swearing bitter vows to the gods or to their dead comrades, bloodsworn travel a path of righteous vengeance. ",
