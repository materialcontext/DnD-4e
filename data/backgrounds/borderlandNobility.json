  "flavor": "Your father or mother is a ruler of an obscure fiefdom along the frontier. The territory is small and out of the way. Nevertheless, your parents are nobility, and that status awards them and their family privileges. As the youngest of many children, you might have no chance of inheriting the realm, but your heritage has afforded you other opportunities, such as attending the best schools, receiving the best martial training, and meeting people of renown. You’ll never inherit your family’s estate, yet you can travel the world and do as you please, carousing, adventuring, and being a layabout. With the military talents your upbringing has provided you, you can succeed in whatever endeavors you undertake.",
