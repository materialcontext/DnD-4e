  "flavor": "You come from a dishonored dragonborn clan. Whether recently or in the distant past, an individual or a family in your clan did something so cowardly, dishonorable, or incompetent that it reflected poorly on the entire clan. Perhaps a group of soldiers deserted the field before a key battle between Arkhosia and Bael Turath. Maybe a sorcerer of your clan destroyed an entire enclave with a miscast spell or botched ritual. Or a warlock made an infernal pact, treated with devils, and joined forces with the empire of Bael Turath. Other dragonborn, if they know your clan name, assume that youâ€™re prone to the same failings, blame you for the actions of your clanmate, or simply taunt you because of your unfortunate heritage. How do you respond to such a reception? Do you hide your clan affiliation, or have you renounced it entirely? Or do you seek to earn such glory that your deeds overshadow those that brought shame to your clan?",
