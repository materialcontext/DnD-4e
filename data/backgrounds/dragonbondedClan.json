  "flavor": "Your clan is still bonded to the service of a dragon, just as it was before the rise of Arkhosia. Your people do not live among other races, but in the remote wilderness near your patron dragonâ€™s lair. The ways of other races and their civilizations are foreign to you, and to their eyes you might seem barbaric or uncultured. Why have you left your close-knit clan, and its service to your dragon patron? Or do you perhaps adventure in service to that patron? Is your patron benevolent, or cruel and domineering?",
