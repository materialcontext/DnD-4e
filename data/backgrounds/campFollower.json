You slept when possible, and when you found yourself in inhospitable conditions, you made do with what you could steal. Your existence sometimes depended on keeping out of sight. You probably jumped from army to armyâ€”when one force crushed another, you would ride on the heels of the victors. Did you grow up and eventually join the ranks, or did this formative experience leave you unwilling to be in the company of any band of warriors larger than your own adventuring party?",
