  "flavor": "From the first time your psionic power manifested, you have been consumed by the feeling that you are beholden to someone—or something—for that power. Do you trace your family line back to the psionics users of Bael Turath? Or do you believe that the diabolic power rumored to still watch over tieflings has granted you this gift? Do you embrace your power regardless? Or do you search endlessly for insights into the origin of psionic power, hoping to understand the nature of that power to prevent it from consuming you?",
