  "flavor": "You grew up in a large town or city that had large buildings and many people. Youâ€™re at home in the bustle of town life, and dodging through crowds is second nature. Perhaps you dress in bright and flashy clothing to stand out among the throngs (and to avoid falling underfoot). Or do you cultivate a quieter existence, where you stay out of sight and out of mind so that you can be left to your own devices in the packed streets? Did you ever long for the hidden forest home you never knew, nestled deep among the roots of massive trees? Or do you feel somehow guilty for not being terribly interested in the traditional home of fey creatures? Do gnomes from the forests find you an oddity when they meet you?",
