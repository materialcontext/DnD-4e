  "previewText": "Far north, well removed from the major byways that cross the more hospitable lands of Faer√ªn, lies frozen Narfell. The region is a desolate wasteland of ice and snow, buffeted by raging storms. Nomadic tribes prowl the countryside in search of resources and supplies, taken from the herds they follow or the people they meet.",
  "benefit": "You add Endurance to your class skill list, and you gain a +3 bonus to Endurance checks.",
  "flavor": "Wintry storms blow death into Narfell from the frigid north, and the temperatures plunge deeper each year, scouring the land of all but the hardiest flora (tough grasses that survive year round) and fauna (herds of reindeer and wild oxen being the most common). Narfell was not always as it is today, as evidenced by the ruins dotting the landscape. Most scholars and historians recall an older empire, a mighty nation that claimed these lands and beyond but eventually fell to death and decay as the result of moral corruption and fell dealings with sinister agencies. The Nars do not linger in or explore these ancient monuments, which suggests that more is at work here than simple superstition. Many explorers share tales of vicious demons and other revolting creatures stalking the isolated remains of the region.",
