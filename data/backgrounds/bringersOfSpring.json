An exploitative power, consumed by evil, this archfey tests the winterkin by sending agents forth to infiltrate the border fortresses and turn the winterkin toward his purpose. To combat the Pale Prince’s growing threat, many warriors join a loose coalition named the Bringers of Spring, and they make it their life’s work to strike against the archfey’s forces, root out their infiltrators, and oppose the archfey at all fronts. You were a Bringer of Spring and fought against the archfey’s forces. How did this service end? Were you a lone survivor or did you break from the society for another reason? How do you see these warriors now?",
