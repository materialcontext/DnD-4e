You canâ€™t escape the memories and the other lifetimes are nearly silent now, just faint wisps that surface only to level accusations and recriminations. How do you cope with the guilt? Are you at risk of falling again? Personal Quests: Enter a rakshasa stronghold and rescue slaves; aid another deva in gaining forgiveness for past atrocities; locate a rakshasa you once associated with and either lead it to redemption or kill it forever.",
