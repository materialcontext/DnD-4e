  "flavor": "You were raised in a pochte clan, a family group dedicated to mercantile pursuits. Tsalaxa is the largest and best-known group outside Draj, but a number of other pochte clans exist. Whereas most Draji are xenophobic, you have dealt with foreigners all your life, and you understand their ways. Pochte traders have a reputation as sly, ruthless dealers who dabble in espionage and intrigue; do you live up to that stereotype, or are you more honest? Are you always looking for the next chance to barter, or have you left your caste behind in your adventures?",
