Some tieflings who learn your background see you as cursed and alone, while others grow jealousat your opportunity to turn away from the past. Was your house mighty or humble? Does your heritage make you proud or ashamed? Do you seek to reestablish your house, or would you be happier ending its sinister reputation once and for all? What events led to you being the last of your line? Have you been marked for death by the murderer of your noble house? Or are you somehow responsible for the elimination of your lineage?",
