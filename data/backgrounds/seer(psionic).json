In time, you began to witness your dreams unfolding in realityâ€”predictive visions that you have come to know as true dreams. As you grew older, you began to experience the true dreams at will, allowing you to scout the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, your talent provides you with insights into the situations that await you, your companions, and the folk that come to you seeking aid and advice. But what you see does not always come to pass, for the future is mutable. How much do you depend on your visions? Do you see the prophesied future as a destination toward which you must walk, or as a warning of a destiny that you can consciously avoid?",
