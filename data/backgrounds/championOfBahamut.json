You strive to be a living incarnation of his will in the world, an extension of his mighty claws. His principles of honor and justice, vigilance against evil, and protecting the weak guide every decision you make and inform your every action. Some might call you naive, blind to the harsh realities of life in this dark age, and perhaps you are—but that doesn’t make you wrong.Most champions of Bahamut are paladins or clerics, espousing a particular ideal of Bahamut as a warrior deity. You might gird yourself in shining platinum-colored armor—or perhaps your scales are naturally that color, a sign of your god’s favor and calling. You might choose cold damage for your dragon breath and feats such as Frost Breath and Freezing Breath to emulate the Platinum Dragon’s frosty breath.",
