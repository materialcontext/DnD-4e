  "flavor": "Mercenary isn’t quite the right word. It sounds too formal, too militaristic. No, you worked for a living, and as ugly as that work got, it put food on the table and coins in your purse. Your life as a hired sword wasn’t easy—and you have the scars to prove it—yet those who crossed you always got the worse end of the bargain.Why was fighting for money the best way to make a living? Are you still for hire? Did your work earn you a reputation, and is it one you welcome or regret? What kinds of jobs did you take—pushing around merchants, shadowy bodyguard work for a spoiled noble, or something much worse? Were there jobs you wouldn’t take? Does anyone still owe you pay? Did you make any enemies while working for others’ interests?Sellsword is a good background for fighters and warlords, but as a ranger or rogue your employment might have put you in more secretive roles. Perhaps instead of a soldier you were a scout, or rather than an armed guard you acted as a plainclothes bodyguard.Consider feats that emphasize your history as someone who lived by the blade. Nimble Blade, Quick Draw, and Toughness might be good choices.",
