However, your temper has often got the better of you, and you were encouraged at an early age to take up a martial art to channel your inner fire.

When you killed a prominent citizen in a duel that escalated from a minor quibble, you knew that your darker moods had become a major liability. Your family ostracized you for your uncouth behavior, and now the only trade you seem to be suited for is that of a freebooting scoundrel.Recommended Feat: Sambrese Rake",
