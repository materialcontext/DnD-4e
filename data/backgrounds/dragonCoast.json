  "previewText": "Mention of the Dragon Coast evokes images of dark alleys and underhanded dealings, of thieves’ guilds and pirate ships. The Dragon Coast summons adventure to it as few other places in Faerûn do. As a result of recent changes, the traditionally safe places of this region have grown a little safer, but the dangerous parts have grown much deadlier.",
  "benefit": "You can reroll any Insight check, but you must keep the second result, even if it is worse.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also gain one additional language of your choice.",
  "flavor": "Westgate is among the freest and the most disreputable locations in Faerûn, a place where coin can purchase anything. However, other areas have seen change in the past few decades. With the receding of the Sea of Fallen Stars, Ilipur and Pros have withered away into ghost towns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nathlekh, Proskur, and Teziir, meanwhile, have seen a boom in trade. These cities have undergone transformations, emerging as law-bound centers of fair trade and honest dealings. Cormyr annexed Proskur in 1405 DR and later adopted Teziir as a protectorate. On the other hand, Nathlan (and its capital, Nathlekh) has emerged as a strong, independent country—the Eastern nation of the West, as some people say.",
