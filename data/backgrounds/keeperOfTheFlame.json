As one of its attendants, you are a member of an esoteric society known as the Keepers of the Flame who are well versed in secret lore. Are you a wizard in the custom of ancient Nerath, or perhaps a simple scholar keeping alive the living light of humanityâ€™s mightiest civilization? You recognize that you and your order possess the most powerful symbol of ancient Nerath, but to what end? Are your efforts futile, or will they illuminate the path to greatness?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Quests: Protect your shrine from looters; deliver an ember of your fire to another city and raise a shrine in its honor; reclaim the Flame Imperishable from the gnolls.",
