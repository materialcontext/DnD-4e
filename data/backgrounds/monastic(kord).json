  "flavor": "The monastery defined your early life. You might have trained in a secluded temple, hidden high in the mountains as Moradin’s and Kord’s often are. Or perhaps your home was tucked away in a city, concealed by powerful wards so it blends in, unseen, such as Erathis’s monasteries sometimes are. How did you come to this monastery? What was life like for you? In what ways did you excel in your training? In what ways did you fall short?",
