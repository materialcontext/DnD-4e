  "flavor": "As you walk the road ahead, you leave your past behind you where it belongs. When you came of age, you pulled up stakes and left everyone and everything you knew. Is fate drawing you toward a particular location or individual, or is the unconscious pull you feel compelling you to fulfill some inscrutable purpose? Are you traveling to escape something, perhaps to overcome a loss, a conflict, or a humiliation? Whatever your reason, you do not or cannot put down roots. Before you run the risk of settling into any particular place, you pick up and move on again.",
