  "flavor": "You are on the run from a harsh authority. Did you commit an actual crime, or were you falsely accused? What might happen if you were found out? How do you react to authority now? Do you try not to draw attention to yourself, for fear of being recognized, or do you boldly challenge anyone with a badge? Would you ever return to face those who accuse you, perhaps once you’ve found evidence of your innocence? Or do you plan on taking revenge on corrupt officials who framed you? Did the authorities put a bounty on your head? If so, do you seek to evade the bounty hunters, or do you face them head-on, hoping to discourage others from trying their luck against you? Stick to the shadows and keep your ears open to any rumors of your pursuers’ whereabouts.",
