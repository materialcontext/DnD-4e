Heroes and villains of yore dance in your visions, and you might find that quests which long ago went unfulfilled seem once again important to you. You could learn of a place long left unprotected that requires a new defender, and that steward might be you. The myth of your own race’s creation (“The Seedling Myth”) plays through your dreams, and you wonder if it holds truth. It doesn’t matter; the myth resonates with your heartwood.",
