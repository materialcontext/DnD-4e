  "flavor": "The renegade quori were driven from Dal Quor because of their faith in the Path of Light, and their belief that the Darkness That Dreams can be replaced by il-Yannah, the Great Light. This faith continues to drive you to this day. If you are a Duulora avenger, you strike with righteous fury borne from your faith, and if you are a hashalaq cleric or paladin, you use charisma and diplomacy to inspire mortals to turn away from darkness. When it comes to battle, psychic power and the radiant force of il-Yannah combine within you to make you a fearsome foe. How can you reflect both aspects of your culture? Are you a kalashtar ardent who falls upon training as a paladin to ref lect your faith? Or have you recently discovered the need to find and destroy those who oppose the light?",
