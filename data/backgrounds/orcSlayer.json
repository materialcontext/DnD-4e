War masters channel this destructive energy into useful ways, assembling strike teams to hunt down and destroy orc tribes. These missions have a high attrition rate, so only the most reckless and crazed warriors are chosen. You were such a warrior, but unlike your peers, you survived. You might have lived because no enemy could stand against you. You might have been lucky. Or, perhaps you were recruited for the mission and had no business being amid the other berserkers, and somehow escaped the fighting. How do you look on your good fortune? Have you returned to your people? If not, how would they greet you?",
