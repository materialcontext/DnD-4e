  "flavor": "Your clan takes its name from Sentune, a famous philosopher who emphasized exploring paths. One cannot take every option, but neither should one choose blindly. By Sentune’s way of thinking, experimentation and exploration should be at the root of every minotaur’s life. Clan Sentune is thus a nomadic clan. Small groups and individuals wander separately for long periods only to gather for seasonal celebrations at spots decided upon at the previous celebration. Other minotaurs consider members of your clan permissive and idle vagabonds. In fact, many members of your clan become involved with strange gods or take up odd professions, and when the clan gathers you have the opportunity to discuss the choices individuals have made and to learn from others’ successes and mistakes.",
