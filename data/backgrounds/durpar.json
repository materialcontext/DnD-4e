  "previewText": "The kingdom of Durpar lies south of the Raurin Desert, in the southeastern corner of Faerûn. Long thought destroyed by residents of the rest of the continent, this coastal kingdom is beset by the menacing monsters of the Beastlands. The remnants of Durpar’s once-wealthy chakas (merchant houses) survive through trade with Estagund and High Imaskar, while the ruling Datharathi chaka experiments with magic crystal inlays.",
  "benefit": "You gain a +2 bonus to all Perception checks.",
  "flavor": "Durpar consists of the city of Vaelan, the town of Assur, and a handful of scattered keeps. Although largely forgotten by the rest of Faerûn, the region survives under the rulership of the Datharathi chaka, despite the threat of the surrounding Beastlands. Goblins of the Iron Eye tribe patrol the streets of Vaelan, and whispers speak of bribes paid to the shadowy Beast Lords, so some people might say that Durpar has already become a monster-ruled land.",
