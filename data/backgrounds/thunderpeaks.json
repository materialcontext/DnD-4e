  "flavor": "Spine of the world, the Thunderpeaks have long been deemed insurmountable by travelers. No pass threads between the peaks, no road climbs their dizzying heights. Worse, black storm clouds gather overhead, herded by inexplicable wind currents, to lash the peaks with lightning and constant rain. The Thunderpeaks offer a glimpse into the raw and often violent nature of primal power. Intrepid souls who scale their heights soon taste its potency.Goliaths make the best Thunderpeaks characters, although dwarves and dragonborn can also emerge from this homeland. Barbarians are an obvious choice for character class, but wardens serve as well.",
