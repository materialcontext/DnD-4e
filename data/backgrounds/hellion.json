  "flavor": "You grew up on the streets and learned everything you know in filthy alleys, backroom brawls, and rooftop gang fights. As a youngster you were fascinated by the culture of the bravo, the rake, and the duelist. In time, you earned a reputation as a hellion, showing a capacity for being tough and improvisational in a fight. You ran the streets and roofs, engaging in duels and brawls with other hellions. You are one with the night, and you revel in the thrills of street life. You evade guards and rivals by using your knowledge of the city, and when you fight, itâ€™s always on your terms. Above all, you live for excitement.",
