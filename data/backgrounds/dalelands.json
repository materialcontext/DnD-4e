  "previewText": "Along the periphery of the elf-ruled forest of Cormanthor lie the Dalelands, a group of loosely allied communities that share common cultures and traditions. Linked by winding trade roads and their alliance against the encroaching powers to the north, west, and south, the Dales are known for their lush forests, fertile farmland, and fierce independence.",
  "benefit": "You can reroll any Nature check, but you must keep the second result, even if it is worse.<br/> You also gain a +1 bonus on initiative checks",
  "flavor": "The northern Dales have largely prospered over the last century, thanks to a strong alliance with elf-ruled Myth Drannor and close ties with the kingdom of Cormyr to the south and west. The southern Dales have fallen under the sway of Sembia as that merchant kingdom continues its gradual, yet relentless, expansion northward.",
