No doubt this encounter intensified your hatred of the drow. But is your hatred now mixed with fear? Or is it a burning drive to exact revenge? Perhaps something about the encounter gave you a trace of compassion for the drow. Do you hope that they might one day be redeemed and rejoin the eladrin fold?",
