  "previewText": "Amid roiling clouds of purple dust rises the newly founded empire of High Imaskar, some 4,000 years absent from Toril. Its appearance marks the return of an ancient and much-reviled nation, a people whose stamp on history continues to foster fear and distrust. Although High Imaskar has broken with many of its former customs, its checkered past stoke the suspicions of times gone by.",
  "benefit": "You can reroll any Arcana check, but you must keep the second result, even if it is worse.<br/> You also know Deep Speech as an additional language.",
  "flavor": "High Imaskar stands on the ruins of ancient Mulhorand, a nation shattered nearly a century ago by the Spellplague, its people destroyed, its gods vanished. In the vast emptiness came the Imaskari, appearing as if they had stepped through millennia of history, untouched and unchanged. Beginning with the reemergence of the Palace of the Purple Emperor, the Imaskari extended their influence throughout the vacated lands and even farther. High Imaskar has been careful to break with its more sinister traditions, going so far as to abolish slavery in all forms. Yet its natural penchant for magic and its adherence to other old customs lead many to question the nationâ€™s true motives.",
