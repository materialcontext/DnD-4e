  "flavor": "Your people are a race of fierce warriors, but you know more effective ways to accomplish your goals than hammer and axe. Words hold power over emotions. Against ignorance, knowledge cuts sharper than any blade. The arm wields the axe, but the mind, spirit, and voice can control far mightier weapons. How does your clan view your choice? Do they respect your power or condemn you for weakness? Are you favored by the gods or feared as a practitioner of black magic?",
