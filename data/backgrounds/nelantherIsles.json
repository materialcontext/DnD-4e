  "previewText": "The Nelanther Isles spread outward from Amn and fade far out into the Trackless Sea, more than a thousand specks of land making up this archipelago. A noted haven for some of the most bloodthirsty pirates to sail the waters of the Sword Coast and beyond, these islands are no place for the unwary.",
  "benefit": "You add Acrobatics and Athletics to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Acrobatics checks and Athletics checks.",
  "flavor": "Born from the swelling trade routes between the Sword Coast and southern mercantile centers, the Nelanther Isles served as the perfect launching point for piracy. From these tiny islands, fleets of pirates worried the shipping lanes, striking without warning and leaving bloody seas choked with corpses, burned hulks, and sinking ships. The raiders also struck coastal settlements, small towns, and anyone and anything they wanted, flaunting their power and savagery in the faces of the nations that bore the brunt of their attacks. If there was one boon from the horrors of the Spellplague, it was the sea swells that washed away much of the piratesâ€™ presence from the isles. Towering waves and violent storms cleansed many islands of their settlements and dispersed or sank huge numbers of ships until only a few battered survivors remained. However, renewed trade between the continental nations has prompted new pirates to stalk the sea lanes once more.",
