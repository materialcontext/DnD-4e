  "flavor": "In the final days of the Last War, armies started deploying Vadalis griffon riders against other griffon riders. And unlike the other dragon marked houses doing business with the warring states, House Vadalis had a brief internal battle. You flew one of those griffons into battle: What happened? Did you down any enemy ridersâ€” and did they survive the battle to seek vengeance? What other dangers did you face from the ground? Do you miss the sensation of flight, or are you glad to be on the ground?",
