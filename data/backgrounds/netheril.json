  "previewText": "The Empire of Netheril has risen from the desert sands of Anauroch, a land wreathed in shadow that dominates the northern reaches of Faerûn. The floating cities of Shade Enclave and Sakkors rule the great basin between the High Ice and the Stonelands, and hold the nearby land of Sembia in thrall.",
  "benefit": "You add Arcana and History to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Arcana checks and History checks.",
  "flavor": "The Empire of Netheril has been reborn, thanks to the return of its residents from their centuries-long exile in the Shadowfell. Under the strict rule of the Twelve Princes, the returned Netherese, now calling themselves Shadovar, are ascendant, having defeated old enemies and reclaimed what they see as their rightful place in Faerûn. The region is growing increasingly verdant with each passing year, and its enemies remain at bay, fearful of Netheril’s potent magic but unable to contain the tendrils of shadow spread by Netherese infiltrators.",
