  "flavor": "The Spellplague drained much of the water of theVilhon Reach and unleashed the Plaguewrought Land upon the region. Like other frontiers, the Vilhon Wilds is an ungoverned wilderness. The only vestige of civilization is the small, near-lawless city of Ormpetarr, where merchants and thieves prey on pilgrims who seek something from a visit to the Spellplague-riddled land nearby.",
