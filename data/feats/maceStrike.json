    "benefit": "When you make a melee basic attack with a mace against a target’s AC, you can use power strike before making the attack roll. Instead of gaining the power’s normal benefit, you make the attack against the target’s Fortitude, rather than AC. In addition, if the attack hits, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll against the target. This bonus increases to +4 at 11th level and +6 at 21st level."
