    "benefit": "If a wizard power has a range of 10 squares or fewer, increase the power’s normal range by 2 squares. If a wizard power has a range of 11–20 squares, increase the power’s normal range by 5 squares. This also applies to area powers, so an area burst 1 within 10 becomes an area burst 1 within 12."
