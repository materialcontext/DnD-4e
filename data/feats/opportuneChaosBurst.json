    "benefit": "When you make your first attack roll each turn, choose odd numbers or even numbers. If you chose odd and the result on the die is an odd number, your Chaos Burst class feature allows you to roll two saving throws against effects that a save can end. If you chose even and the result on the die is an even number, your Chaos Burst class feature grants you a +3 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn."
