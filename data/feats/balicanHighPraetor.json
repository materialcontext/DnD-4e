    "benefit": "Whenever an enemy you have cursed drops to 0 hit points, you gain the following benefit in addition to regaining the use of your fell might. The next ally you can see that hits with a damaging attack before the start of your next turn subjects its target to your Warlock’s Curse. If the target is already under your curse, the ally’s attack instead deals extra damage equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier."
