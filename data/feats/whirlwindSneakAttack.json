    "benefit": "Choose a rogue encounter attack power that you know. You can deal Sneak Attack damage to every target you hit with that power, and doing so counts as one use of Sneak Attack. You still must have combat advantage against a target to deal the extra damage to it, and you can’t deal the extra damage more than once to any target, even if the power attacks that target multiple times."
