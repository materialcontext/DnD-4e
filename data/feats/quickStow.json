    "benefit": "When you use wild shape to change from your humanoid form to beast form, you don’t automatically drop handheld items that aren’t implements. Such items become part of your beast form. However, you gain no benefit from a handheld item, such as a shield, that must be wielded to be functional, and you can use only the properties and powers of the item that don’t require you to make an attack with it."
