    "benefit": "When you speak or use your Mimicry racial feature, you can make the sound seem to originate from a square within 5 squares of you. You must succeed on a Bluff check to fool listeners into believing the sound came from that location. If the square is occupied by a creature, that creature knows it didnâ€™t make the sound, and you take a -2 penalty to the Bluff check against other listeners."
