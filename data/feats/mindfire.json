    "benefit": "Your darkfire power gains the augmentable keyword. When you would use this power, you can spend 1 power point to target Will instead of Reflex. In addition to the normal effects from a hit, the target treats creatures more than 5 squares away from it as having total concealment until the end of your next turn."
