    "benefit": "Whenever you use elven accuracy, the rerolled attack roll ignores cover and concealment, and it deals fire and necrotic damage in addition to its normal damage types if it hits. If you have the Student of the Plague feat, use elven accuracy, and hit with the rerolled attack roll, the target of that roll and each creature adjacent to it take fire and necrotic damage equal to 1 + one-half your level."
