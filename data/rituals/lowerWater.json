    "text": "You cause a body of water to reduce in depth. Your Nature check determines how many squares the water lowers. The space of water you can affect has sides equal to your level in squares. For example, if you are level 12, you affect a space that is 12 squares on a side. If you lower the water to ground level or lower, the affected area becomes dry. In large bodies of water, the water outside the area is unaffected by the void you create. To an observer, the sides of the area appear to be walls of water. At the end of the ritual’s duration, water returns to fill the volume it previously occupied.",
