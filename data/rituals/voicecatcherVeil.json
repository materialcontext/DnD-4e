    "text": "No telepathy or other mental communication can cross the boundary of Voicecatcher Veil, unless the creature using it is either of a higher level than the ritual caster who performed the ritual, or that ritual caster permits it. When mental communication is attempted across the wardâ€™s boundary, the ritual caster is instantly aware of the attempt and the contents of the message. The caster can then choose to bar the message or let it pass, as long as the caster is capable of thought. (If the caster is incapable of thought or dead, the veil automatically bars all communication.) The ritual caster can pass this power and responsibility on to another creature in the presence of the veil by spending a healing surge; that individual can likewise pass it to another by the same means. Your Arcana check result determines the size of the warded area, which is a burst.",
