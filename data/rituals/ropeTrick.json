    "text": "When you perform Rope Trick, the ritual’s focus passes through a portal and into a temporary demiplane. The portal entrance occupies 1 square. A creature can climb down the rope into a demiplane that is 2 squares high, 8 squares long, and 8 squares wide.  The entrance to the demiplane appears as a subtle shimmer and has solid transparency. A successful Perception check (DC 15 + half your level) allows a creature outside the portal to detect the entrance. The portal can be locked with the Arcane Lock ritual, and unless you choose to lock the portal, the demiplane remains accessible from the outside.  Once the ritual ends, the demiplane disappears, and any creatures or objects in the demiplane appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the demiplane’s former entrance. The ritual’s focus appears where the demiplane’s entrance was. The ritual caster can choose to end the ritual at any time.  Focus: A silver rope worth at least 2,000 gp.",
