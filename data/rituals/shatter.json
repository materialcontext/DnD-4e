    "text": "You can shatter all nonmagical objects composed of crystal, glass, ceramic, porcelain and similar fragile materials in a 2-square radius centered on you. An object heavier than 5 pounds, larger than Tiny, or more valuable than 25 gp is immune to this area effect.  You can instead focus the effect on one object of the proper composition. An object heavier than 50 pounds, larger than Medium, or more valuable than 250 gp is immune to this targeted effect.  Ritual Scroll: You can perform this ritual as a standard action when you do so from a scroll. If you do, the ritual affects only a 1-square area, and the DM makes a saving throw for each object in the area. On a save, the object is unaffected. If you use the targeted effect, the target gains a +2 bonus to the saving throw.",
