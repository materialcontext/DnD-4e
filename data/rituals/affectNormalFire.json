You can make a fire that normally provides dim light produce an equal amount of bright light, or you can double the radius of bright light a fire produces. Alternatively, you can diminish a fire’s light, reducing its area of bright light to an equal amount of dim light, or reducing its area of dim light to darkness. Reducing a fire’s light to produce no light does not extinguish the flame. You can extinguish 1 square of nonmagical fire as a minor action.",
