These can range from specific individuals to members of broad categories, such as creature origin or type. A creature can discern the illusion if it succeeds on an Arcana check or a Perception check (DC 10 + your Arcana check modifier). Unlocking the lock, using the mechanism, or identifying the illusion discharges the ritual.",
