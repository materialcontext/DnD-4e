    "text": "When you perform this ritual, choose a specific active and permanent portal you can clearly see. Analyze Portal causes the portal to erupt with faint lights that flicker and spin, letting you learn a great deal about its destination and function. Its most basic effect is to reveal the portal’s destination. Although a portal usually displays what its destination looks like, this ritual reveals the destination’s name and its general location in the world or the plane on which it is located.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you learn the origin and type of the last creature to use the portal, you also learn any keywords associated with that creature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyze Portal can also reveal the identity of the creature that created the portal. If no creature created it, you learn of the event that created it.",
