When you perform this ritual, you transport yourself and up to eight allies from the world to a corresponding location in the Feywild, or from the Feywild to a corresponding location in the world. The fey crossing need not be active for Fey Passage to work.  You remain in the Feywild until you leave by another means or you perform this ritual again at a fey crossing.  Special: Eladrin have a special connection to the Feywild. Consequently, an eladrin who has mastered this ritual or performs it from a scroll does not pay the component cost.",
