This barrier can be a closed circle, with an inscription time of 1 minute per square inside the circle, or a line, requiring 1 minute per 2 squares of length. An undead creature whose level is lower than your  Arcana check result â€“ 10 cannot pass through the barrier, affect creatures through the barrier, or affect the barrier in any way. Any other undead creature takes radiant damage equal to your Arcana check result when passing through the barrier, but doing so breaks the barrier and ends the effect. Any creature able to pass through the barrier can take a standard action to obscure the inscription and thereby break the barrier.",
