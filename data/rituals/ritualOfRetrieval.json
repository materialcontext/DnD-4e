On the first round after you die, your body and all your possessions burn away to ash, reforming (still dead) in the locale you attune with this ritual. If the attuned location has been destroyed or altered in a way that prevents your body’s return, the ritual fails.  Your Arcana check determines how long your retrieval site remains attuned.",
