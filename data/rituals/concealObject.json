Any creature with line of sight to the object is entitled to a Perception check at a DC equal to your Arcana check result with a +5 bonus. A creature that touches the object gains a +5 bonus to the check, and a creature that is rudely forced to notice the object (such as by walking into a wall it was unable to notice) automatically sees the concealed object. Moving the concealed object ends the effect.",
