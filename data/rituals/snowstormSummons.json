The bearer of the staff controls the blizzard’s general tendencies, such as the direction and intensity of the wind or the degree of obscurity from snow. The bearer of the staff cannot control specific applications of the weather, such as specific gusts of wind or specific squares of obscuring terrain. The altered weather persists for a duration you choose up to the maximum determined by your skill check result.",
