    "text": "Choose a specific outdoor location that you have previously visited and that is within 1 mile of your current position. The location must be fixed in place, and it must be at the same place as when you last visited. You place a scrying sensor in a square up to 10 squares above that location. Gazing into your focus (a pool of water), you can see and hear from that square as if you occupied it.  The sensor remains for 2 rounds. You can extend the duration by another 2 rounds by spending a healing surge.  A scrying sensor appears as a shimmer in the air. Creatures can spot the sensor by succeeding on a Perception check (DC 10 + your level).  Some warding rituals can block scrying sensors. If the location is so warded, or the location is otherwise unviable as a scrying target, then you learn this fact as soon as you start the ritual. You can then stop the ritual before you expend any components.  Focus: A 1-square or larger pool of clean water.",
