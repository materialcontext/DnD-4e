A single memory sealed away by this ritual can be specific (“seeing me stealing the Darlingian Scepter” or “how to enter my secret laboratory”) or general (“what you read in my journal” or “the last conversation you had today”).  A target of this ritual must be either willing or helpless for the duration of the ritual. You can target yourself with this ritual only if you have at least one assistant in performing it. On an unwilling target, your Arcana check result must beat the target’s Will defense for the ritual to succeed, in addition to determining how hard the ritual is on the target (in terms of damage; see below).",
