    "text": "You inscribe a glyph that works as a dangerous trap (see Glyph of Warding trap) on a flat surface such as a wall, chest lid, table, or door. As you create the trap, you set the glyph’s damage type, trigger, password and/or exceptions. The trigger you set must require the trap’s target to enter the glyph’s square, pass within range of the glyph’s attack, or open or handle a warded object without speaking the password or meeting an exception. Acceptable exceptions include creature origin, creature type, physical characteristics, and named individuals. The glyph becomes nearly invisible once it is completed. If the trap is triggered or disabled, the ritual is discharged.",
