It remains stationary unless you move more than 5 squares away from it, in which case it moves with your base speed once per round until it is within 5 squares of you. You can command the disk to move up to your speed as a move action. If you are more than 5 squares from the disk for 2 consecutive rounds, the disk disappears, dropping whatever it was carrying.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Arcana check result determines the maximum load the disk can carry.",
