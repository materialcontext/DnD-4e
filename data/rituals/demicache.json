The portal floats near you or can be affixed to your clothing (like a pocket), and you can retrieve items from the portal as a minor action. The portal is visible to others, and it moves with you at your speed.  At the completion of the ritual, make an Arcana check. The result determines how long the portal stays open. If the portal closes before you retrieve the stowed objects, they appear at your feet.",
