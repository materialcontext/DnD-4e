Upon the ritual’s completion, the creature’s size increases by one category. This change does not alter the beast’s statistics, though its Strength is considered 8 higher for the purpose of determining how much the creature can carry, drag, or lift. In addition, the beast gains a +4 power bonus to Strength checks (but not to attack rolls or damage rolls). The ritual’s effect ends if the beast dies, at which point it reverts to its normal size.",
