    "text": "Special: You must possess an innate breath weapon You cause creatures in a warded area to gain vulnerability to whatever damage type you deal with your breath weapon. (A red dragon, for instance, would bestow fire vulnerability with this ritual.) Any time an intruder takes damage of the appropriate type, it takes the extra damage.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Arcana check determines the size of the area warded, as well as the extent of the vulnerability.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are automatically immune to your own Chamber of Vulnerability. In addition, you can designate any number of other ritual participants as being immune also. When you perform the ritual, you can also designate one or more categories of creatures that are immune to the ritual’s effects. You can define these categories by obvious physical characteristics (such as height, weight, or body shape), creature type (such as dragon), creature race (such as blue dragon), or obvious equipment (such as a creature wearing a specific signet ring).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ritual’s effects last for 24 hours.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by keeping a focus in the vicinity. This ritual focus is a small fanged mouth carved of ivory and silver, worth 2,500 gp. The Chamber of Vulnerability lasts as long as the focus remains within the area of effect. You can hide or protect the ritual’s focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within range.",
