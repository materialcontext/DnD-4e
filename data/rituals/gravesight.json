For the ritual’s duration, you can spend a standard action to use the affected creature’s senses. You use your Perception modifier when you do so. While sensing through the undead, you cannot use your own senses and are considered blind and deaf. You can end the effect as a free action. If the undead creature is destroyed, the ritual ends immediately.  Your Arcana check determines the maximum distance at which you can receive sensory input from the target creature.",
