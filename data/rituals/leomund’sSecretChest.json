    "text": "As part of mastering this ritual, you must create or commission a chest that bears arcane designs, and an object with personal meaning for you must be built into the chest’s frame. After the chest is ready, you can store it anywhere you like. Performing this ritual then summons the chest from wherever you left it to wherever you are, along with all its contents. You can remove or add objects to the chest (subject to its natural size limitations) when it is present. Any time after summoning it, you can dismiss it back to its previous location.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explorers use this ritual to ensure they have enough supplies or to cart treasure away from a dungeon more easily. If the chest is ever lost or destroyed, you must create a new one before you can perform this ritual again.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus: A chest worth at least 200 gp.",
