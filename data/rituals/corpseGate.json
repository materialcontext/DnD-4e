    "text": "You create a portal similar to that produced by Linked Portal, but connecting your present location to that of a corpse. You must have a piece of the corpse—at least as much as the tip of a finger—in your possession to begin the ritual. This piece is consumed at the ritual’s completion.  If the target corpse is alive, animate, undead, or otherwise more than a simple corpse, or if the corpse is on another plane, the ritual fails and no components (including the bit of the corpse) are expended.  Your Arcana check result determines how long the portal remains open.",
