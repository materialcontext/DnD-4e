    "text": "Targets of the Waterborn ritual can explore the oceanâ€™s depths at length and with leisure. Up to eight creatures (including yourself if you choose) gain the ability to breathe underwater. In addition to this ability, targets can speak normally and gain a swim speed equal to their land speed. Subjects are unaffected by the cold and pressure of the deep ocean.  This ritual does not negate the ability to breathe air or move on land. Equipment and possessions, such as books and scrolls, on a creature affected by the ritual remain undamaged by the water.",
