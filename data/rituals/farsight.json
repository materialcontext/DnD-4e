You can see and hear as if you were standing there, and you have darkvision through the sensor. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor. You cannot place the scrying sensor in a location you can see only through a scrying sensor.  Your Arcana check result determines how long the sensor lasts.",
