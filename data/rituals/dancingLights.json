    "text": "You create up to four floating orbs of light, or one light of vaguely humanoid shape. These lights can be of any color. Each orb sheds bright light in a 2-square radius; a humanoid-shaped light sheds dim light in a 2-square radius.  Each light has a fly speed of 10. Whenever you use a move action to move, you can move all the lights as part of that action. You can also use a minor action to move all your lights up to their speed. You must have line of effect to a light to move it. Any light goes out if it is more than 20 squares from you at the end of your turn.",
