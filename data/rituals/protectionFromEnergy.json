The target, whether you or someone else, can provide the healing surge component cost. Choose a damage type from among acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. The next time the target takes damage of that type, the ritual is discharged, and the damage is reduced by an amount equal to 10 + your Arcana check modifier or Religion check modifier.  If the target is already under this ritual’s effect when the ritual is used upon the target again, the newer effect cancels the older one.   Ritual Scroll: You can perform this ritual as a standard action when you do so from a scroll. If you do, you reduce the damage the target takes by an amount equal to 5 + your Arcana check modifier or Religion check modifier.",
