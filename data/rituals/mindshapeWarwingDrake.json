It is loyal to the ritual caster or someone the ritual caster designates. Such a drake can be trained to accept other potential riders and masters. If the ritual grants the drake the ability to speak, the drake speaks in a broken form of a language the ritual caster selects. If use of this ritual reduces a warwing drake to 0 Intelligence, the drake dies.",
