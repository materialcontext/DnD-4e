    "text": "You create a source of dim light that allows you and those around you to see without your being seen because of your light source.  The Dark Light ritual creates a ball of shadow that floats with you as you walk. It sheds dim light within 6 squares around it.  In its light, you can see everything clearly. Only creatures within the lightâ€™s radius can see the Dark Light ball or the dim light it creates. Vision within the Dark Light effect is in black-and-white, and color variations appear in shades of gray.",
