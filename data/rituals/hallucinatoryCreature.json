If the creature can speak or emit sounds, the illusion can do so as well, but on a limited basis (subject to the DM’s judgment)—it’s not possible, for instance, for the illusion to engage in an extended conversation.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can give the illusion simple instructions, such as having it wander a set area, appear to chew on local plants, and the like. Your Arcana check determines the number of actions you can instruct the illusion to take.",
