Any scrying sensor within 10 squares of an affected creature sees only the illusion you choose at the ritual’s conclusion. The illusion can contain anything you desire, with up to 5 minutes of programmed actions. Creatures viewing the illusion are entitled to an Insight check to detect the fact that it is false. This check’s DC equals your Arcana check result. A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees the illusion.",
