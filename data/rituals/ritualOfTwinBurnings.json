    "text": "This complicated and deeply evil ritual must be performed a total of nine times to subjugate the will of a creature held in Thakorsil’s Seat. Each performance has the following requirements.  It must be performed during a full moon within 20 feet of Thakorsil’s Seat.  It requires the sacrifice of a good-aligned creature of at least paragon tier. That creature dies at the last second of the performance, when its body and spirit are utterly destroyed—hence “twin burnings.”  If the performance is successful, it creates a triangular crystalline pane etched with a rune of chaos. The pane appears near the Seat. Any damage destroys a pane, but only missing panes must be replaced in further performance.  If an individual performance is interrupted, it fails. Panes already created remain, though, and the overarching ritual can continue from that point.  If nine performances are successfully completed, a nine-sided crystal pyramid encloses Thakorsil’s Seat. The occupant of the artifact can then physically leave the Seat but is permanently and totally enslaved to the one who completed the ritual.",
