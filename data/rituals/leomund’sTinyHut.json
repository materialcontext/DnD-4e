Creatures other than yourself can enter and exit the hut freely. If you exit the hut, the ritual is discharged.  The sphere’s interior is 70 degrees Fahrenheit, and the exterior keeps out normal weather such as wind, rain, and dust. You can adjust the sphere’s interior luminance from no light to dim light. The sphere is transparent from within but opaque (blocks line of sight) from the outside. Creatures inside the sphere have total concealment from creatures outside it.",
