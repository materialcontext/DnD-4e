You use this ritual either to create a grove and an entrance to it or to create an entrance to a grove that you or someone else created.  Creating a Grove: When you create a grove, it appears in a hidden location in the world or the Feywild, and you determine its password. You also create an entrance to it (see “Creating an Entrance” below).  A grove generates enough food and drink to sustain its occupants and has a moderate, unchanging climate. If you move objects into a grove, they remain there when you leave, but food and other resources created by the grove disappear when removed.  Your Nature check determines the grove’s size in squares and how many creatures it can accommodate.",
