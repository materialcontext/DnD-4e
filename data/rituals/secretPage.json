    "text": "You ward writings so others cannot read them. Use of this ritual protects one page (maximum 250 words). You make the page appear not to exist, causing anyone other than you to ignore it; the page’s presence is blocked from a reader’s mind. You can choose instead to obscure the page with false writings, which you produce before performing the ritual. Other readers see the false text rather than the real text.  When you perform the ritual, make an Arcana check, with a +5 bonus. The result is the DC for a Perception check to notice the concealed writing (readers use passive Perception unless they are specifically looking for concealed text).",
