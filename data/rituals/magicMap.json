    "text": "When you perform this ritual, choose a specific creature. You must have an object that is tied to the creature, such as a bit of hair, a favorite scarf, or a personal weapon. You hold the object in one hand and suspend the focus from the other hand, holding it above a map representing a region no larger than 50 by 50 miles. If the creature is in the area, the focus is drawn to the creature’s exact location as depicted on the map. As you watch, the focus follows the creature’s movement. Your Arcana check determines the duration of the time during which you can pinpoint the creature’s location. This ritual is only as accurate as the map that is used.",
