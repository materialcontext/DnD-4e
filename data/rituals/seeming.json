    "text": "Upon completing the ritual, you and up to eight allies assume the appearance of any Medium humanoid creatures. The ritual allows you to assume the general appearance of a particular race, but not of a unique creature. The ritual’s effect is centered on you; if any ally moves more than 5 squares away from you, the ritual’s effect ends for that ally. Creatures viewing or interacting with you or your allies can make an Insight check to detect the deception. The check’s DC equals your Arcana check result. A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees you and each time it interacts with you or one of your allies. If the creature touches you or an ally, it automatically realizes the deception.",
