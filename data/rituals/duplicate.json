When you complete this ritual, the crude replica transforms into an exact copy of the original. It performs identically to the original in all mundane ways and is not recognizable as a fake, even by someone using the Arcana skill. A copy of a magic item is nonmagical.  Once the duration expires, the object reverts to its original crude clay form.",
