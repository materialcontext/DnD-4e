Modification: Ammunition (level + 1). You create this item for use with a ranged weapon such as a bow, a crossbow, or a sling. Item’s range becomes the range of the weapon but continues to use the indicated attack modifier. The burst area remains unchanged. You do not include a weapon’s proficiency bonus or enhancement bonus in the attack. The item’s component cost corresponds to the table below.",
