The ritual does not make animals friendly, and the animals or plants are limited in their knowledge by their experiences and mobility. For example, a plant knows only about its immediate surroundings, and a fish can describe only what it has seen or experienced underwater. Your Nature check result determines the number of questions you can ask.",
