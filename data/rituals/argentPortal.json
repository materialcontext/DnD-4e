    "text": "You create a special portal that connects to the permanent teleportation circle in Argent’s Grand Mall. When performing the ritual, you inscribe a 10-foot-diameter circle using rare chalks and special sigils. The circle disappears at the end of its duration. An Arcana check determines how long the portal remains open: 19 or lower, 1 round; 20–39, 2 rounds; 40 or higher, 3 rounds. If you are currently in the past, an Arcana check of 30 or better lets you use this ritual to return to Argent in your own time.",
