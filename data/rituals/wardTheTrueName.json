    "text": "If anyone anywhere in the world performs a divination or scrying ritual that is intended to gather information about you—such as someone using Consult Mystic Sages or Consult Oracle to ask questions about you, or using Observe Creature to spy on you—you instantly become aware of it. You do not learn the nature of the ritual caster’s questions or efforts. You learn only the specific ritual that was performed. You also gain the ability to identify the ritual caster well enough to scry upon him or her in turn.  The effect of this ritual ends when you have been alerted to a divination or scrying attempt.",
