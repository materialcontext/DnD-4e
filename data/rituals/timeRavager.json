    "text": "Time Ravager magically accelerates the effects of time on an object, causing it to weaken, decay, and crumble into dust. This ritual affects only nonmagical inanimate objects such as gear, armor, weapons, food, and corpses. A single performance destroys a 5-foot cube of materials of a type based on the Arcana check result.  Unpreserved Organic Materials: This category includes any foodstuffs, liquids, uncured leather, plant materials, carcasses, and so on. A successful ritual results in transforming this substance into foul-smelling slime.  Preserved Organic Materials: These items include cured leather, specially preserved foodstuffs, wooden weapons, and specially treated plant or animal based objects. An item affected dissolves into a disgusting paste.  Metals: This category includes iron doors and bars, weapons, metal jewelry, cutlery, and metallic finished items. Such objects rust or corrode, becoming brittle or turning to dust.  Minerals: Minerals include gemstones such as rubies, diamonds, and similar precious stones, as well as all metal ore. Time Ravager reduces these items to dust.",
