    "text": "You must perform this ritual in an outdoor, aboveground environment. The ritual gathers clouds overhead in a 10-square radius centered on you. When you finish the ritual, precipitation (rain, or snow if the temperature is below freezing) pours from the clouds for the ritual’s duration. This magical precipitation moves with you, remaining centered above your space.  The magical precipitation extinguishes exposed nonmagical flames in the area instantly and lightly obscures all squares in the area. Creatures in the area gain a +2 power bonus to saving throws against ongoing fire damage.  If you go indoors, the ritual is discharged. You can also take a minor action to end the ritual’s effect. In either case, the gathered clouds disappear over the course of 1 minute.",
