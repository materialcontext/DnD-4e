    "text": "When you perform this ritual, you can designate up to eight participants (including yourself if you wish) who breathe water as easily as they breathe air. Furthermore, they can speak normally underwater.  Water Breathing doesn’t change your ability to breathe air. It doesn’t confer a greater swim speed or the ability to fight underwater unhindered. It does protect any gear you and the participants carry, such as books and scrolls, from water damage.  Your check result determines the duration of the effect.",
