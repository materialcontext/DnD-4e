    "text": "You capture the writing from one source (a book, scroll, or tablet) and cause it to appear onto a special prepared paper, parchment, book, or some other similar item. This ritual copies up to 250 words of text, enough to fill one page with text. A copied illustration counts as a number of words proportional to the amount of the page the illustration requires.  This ritual can be used to copy a ritual scroll, even if you have not mastered the ritual on the original scroll. Creating a ritual scroll in this manner takes twice as long as creating a ritual book but has the same cost (in addition to the component cost of this ritual).",
    "flavorText": "You touch the writing, tracing each character or glyph with a gently glowing crystal. As you do so, the words you flicker into existence onto the specially prepared parchment before solidifying into a near-perfect copy.",
