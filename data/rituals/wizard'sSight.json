You create a magical sensor in that square. You can see and hear as if you were standing there, and you have darkvision through the sensor. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Arcana check determines how long the sensor lasts.",
