    "text": "This ritual can only be performed between sunset and sunrise. As part of the ritual, you and the ritual’s subject must drink a small amount of each other’s blood, after which the subject dies and is ritually buried in unhallowed ground. After the interment, you invoke a prayer to Orcus and ask him to bestow “the Dark Gift” upon the subject. At the conclusion of the ritual, the subject remains buried, rising up out of its shallow grave as a vampire lord at sunset on the following day. This ritual is ruined if a raise dead ritual is cast on the subject or if the subject is beheaded before rising as a vampire lord.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performing the ritual leaves you weakened for 1d10 days.",
