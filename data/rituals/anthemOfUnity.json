    "text": "When you perform the Anthem of Unity for a crowd of  ordinary people—peasants, commoners, artisans, and the like—you unite them behind a single cause. Only creatures whose level is at least 2 lower than yours are affected by this ritual. The crowd must not be hostile to you and must be able to see and hear you for the entire performance. At the end of the ritual, you can request a single service from the crowd, to which the members of the audience respond as if you were a trusted friend. You can request anything that doesn’t involve violence, put the listeners at inordinate risk or imperil their friends or family, or place them in financial ruin. For example, you might ask the listeners to help put out a fire raging in the city, hide you and your allies from searching guards, or provide you with shelter or food. A Diplomacy check made at the end of this ritual determines what sort of help you can request.",
    "flavorText": "The anthem’s invigorating notes fill the audience with pride and single-minded purpose.",
