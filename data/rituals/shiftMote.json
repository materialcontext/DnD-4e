    "text": "You seize control of an earthmote and influence its motions. It lurches forward and proceeds slowly across the sky, moving at 1 mile per hour in a direction you choose. You must be on the earthmote to perform the ritual and to direct it. If you leave while the ritual is still in effect, the mote slows to a stop within an hour, traveling one-half mile in that time.  You can also elect to change the moteâ€™s altitude up to 1 mile over the course of the duration.  Those who know this ritual keep it carefully guarded, for the ritual has devastating potential.",
