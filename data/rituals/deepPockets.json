When the ritual is performed, up to five pockets or pouches sewn into the focus can each hold up to 50 pounds in weight or 5 cubic feet in volume. Items in the affected pockets do not change the focus garment’s form or weight. The garment’s wearer can draw an item from an affected pocket as a minor action. When the ritual ends, items in the affected pockets appear in a pile at the garment-wearer’s feet.  Focus: A fine cloth garment (50 gp).",
