A creature can use a minor action to make an Arcana check or a Perception check (DC 10 + your Arcana check modifier) when it sees the illusion. If the check succeeds, the creature discerns the illusory nature of the image. If a creature interacts with the illusion, the illusory nature of the image is immediately apparent, and the ritual is discharged.  Ritual Scroll: You can perform this ritual as a standard action when you do so from a scroll. If you do, the DC of the Arcana or Perception check to discern the illusion is 5 + your Arcana check modifier.",
