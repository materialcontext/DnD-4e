You create an amount of false gold equal to the amount you spend as the ritual’s component cost times a multiplier based on your Arcana check result. Your Arcana check result also determines how long the illusory gold exists. For example, if you expend 100 gp as the component cost and you achieve a result of 25 on your Arcana check, you create 1,000 gp worth of illusory gold that lasts for 4 hours.",
