    "text": "Successfully performing the Raise Land ritual enables you to lift a specific quantity of ground into the air. The depth of the earth affected extends down to half the areaâ€™s radius, thus a 20-square-radius section of land is 10 squares thick. The freed earth rises at a rate of 10 feet per round until it attains a height equal to the radius (or less, if you choose). If this ritual is attempted indoors, the raised land stops once it hits a barrier.",
