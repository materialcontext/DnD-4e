Depending on the deity you worship, the power creates an additional effect:<br/>Aurom: The zone is filled with a mind-numbing gloom. Enemies that begin their turn in the zone are dazed until the start of their next turn.<br/>Haramathur: Those within the zone take on the semblance of stone. While within the zone, allies gain a +2 bonus to AC and Fortitude. Enemies treat the zone as difficult terrain, and enemies that begin their turn in the zone are slowed until the start of their next turn.<br/>Laeris: The zone is filled with a magical mist. Enemies treat the zone as heavily obscured to all senses, including blindsight and tremorsense.<br/>Nusemnee: Pulsing light illuminates the zone. While within the zone, allies gain a +2 power bonus to saving throws and can use second wind as a minor action (or as a free action if they can use second wind as a minor action normally).<br/>Sagawehn: The zone is filled with buzzing insects. While within the zone, enemies have a -2 penalty to attack rolls and to all defenses."
