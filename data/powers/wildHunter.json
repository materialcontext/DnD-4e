Each hound has a speed of 8 and a fly speed of 8 (hover).<br/> Each hound has hit points equal to your healing surge value and uses your defenses, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties, with a +2 bonus to AC and Reflex. Each hound lasts until the end of the encounter or until it drops to 0 hit points. You lose a healing surge if both hounds are destroyed.<br/> As a minor action, you can mentally direct both hounds to crawl, escape, run, stand up, shift, squeeze, or walk. The hounds do not need to perform the same action."
