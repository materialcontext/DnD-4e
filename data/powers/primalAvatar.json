You also gain a fly speed equal to your speed, and you can hover. You can use at-will powers and encounter powers, but you cannot use daily powers, magic item powers, or rituals. You can remain in this form until you end it as a standard action, until you drop to 0 hit points or fewer, or until you take a short rest or an extended rest. When you leave this form, your body reappears, rejoined by your spirit, in your current space."
