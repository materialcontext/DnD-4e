    "text": "Bereg-arnadh is the ancient eladrin art of drawing calligraphy with a blade. Bodyguards of the legendary eladrin queen Suiradrun were the first to use bereg-arnadh, and the practice has since become more widespread. Practitioners of this arcane tradition inscribe magical, glowing characters of Rellanic script into the air with their blades. These hovering runes are charged with arcane power from the calligrapher. The sigils hover for a short time, emitting a lambent radiance that evokes protection for allies or enmity toward foes.<br/>Your mastery of the flying sword makes you an ideal practitioner of bereg-arnadh. Whether you studied texts to learn the art yourself, or you earned the right to study under a master of bereg-arnadh, you have gained the ability to wield the arcane art on the battlefield. On the tip of your blade, you sculpt runes, the mere sight of which strikes fear into your adversaries.",
