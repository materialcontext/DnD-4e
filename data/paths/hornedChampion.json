    "text": "You have communed with the spirits of the land and have been found worthy of the horned champion’s mantle. You transcend the flesh you were born with to become the chosen vessel of nature’s spirits. Your duty is to take up arms against the fell creatures of the land, to put an end to their destruction, and to restore the splendor of the untamed wilds.<br/>Becoming a horned champion is a transformative experience. Gone are the simple concerns that bound you to the world. You see the world on a grander scale, as an organism that must be protected against the abominations that would siphon its strength for dark purposes. You appear to have no ties to people or places, only to your weighty mission, leading many to feel as though you lack understanding of the individual’s plight. Although it’s true that you care little for the individual’s suffering, giving no more attention to a mortal’s difficulties than one would show to an insect, your concern encompasses the natural world and all things living in it. Thus, in a way, your ties to others are deeper than friendship, for they are forged from the bonds that connect all living things.",
