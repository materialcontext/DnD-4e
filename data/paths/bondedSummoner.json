    "text": "You are fascinated by the magic of summoning and conjuration. The power of the planes draws you almost as strongly as your own arcane strength pulls the creatures you call to your side. You form a stronger link than others with the creatures you summon, granting you increased control over them. This closer communication even allows you to manipulate the boundaries between planes. You are a beneficent master, though, and you imbue your summoned servants with greater vitalityâ€”in exchange for even more dedicated service.",
