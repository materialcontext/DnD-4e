    "text": "You’re more at home in the skies aboard a House Lyrandar airship than you are on the ground. Through the power of your dragon mark, you exert control over wind and weather. You’re naturally held aloft by breezes, but the wind isn’t just a constant companion, it’s also a weapon in your arsenal. With the aid of your dragon mark, you can cause sudden bursts of wind that send your enemies flying. With enough power, you can even summon a tornado to tear through your enemy’s ranks. Those who trifle with you feel the fury of the storm.",
