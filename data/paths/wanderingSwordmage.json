    "text": "Though all swordmages are students of both arcane arts and combat, you take this diversity of interest to its  ultimate expression. Strict adherence to a single style or formal school of combat doesn’t interest you. Instead, you build an eclectic fighting style from techniques gathered from far corners of every land. Spells<br/>created by masters whose styles don’t fit into normal swordmage schools are your best weapons.<br/> Your knowledge spans a great number of topics. You could know tales of ancient Cormanthyr, recent events in the Moonshaes, and legends about brave dragonslayers who lived in Abeir long before it returned. You can learn something new from anyone you talk to. Even conflicting views of the same event show you how peoples’ biases can affect their awareness—a weakness you can exploit when fighting. The folklore of each region carries lessons that any warrior can use. In every fable, bit of trivia, or snippet of news, you learn a philosophical lesson that guides you in battle.",
