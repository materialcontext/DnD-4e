Whether they wander for love of maps and food, a search for truth, a lust for treasure or adventure, or a noble quest, their wandering is aided by the lessons they learn from other travelers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a student of the Falling Needle practice and an itinerant, your techniques aid youâ€”typically when others decide to attack you. You move swiftly on the road and in the heat of combat. You might be struck, but you do not remain in place for a second blow.",
