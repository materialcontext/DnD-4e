    "text": "Ancient scrolls speak of the world’s last days, foretelling a time of violence and destruction that will consume everything. You have studied these scrolls and know the disasters destined to befall the world: nine terrible catastrophes that will one day cause its doom. These supernatural disasters were sown in the world’s foundations during the first days and now lie buried beneath mighty seals in its far corners. It is your task to ensure that these seals remain intact, for each time some evil power breaks one, the end of all things draws closer. Those who meddle with the seals flirt with the destruction of all and risk upsetting the great purpose of the cosmos.",
