    "text": "Your mind rejects all notions of what is possible and impossible on the battlefield. Psionic energy flows through you, imbuing you with an irrepressible need to move. You flow around your enemies, blurring past them before they can land a blow. As you move, your attacks slip through your enemiesâ€™ defenses with deadly effect. You goad a foe into following you, then wrack its mind and body as it gives futile chase.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are quicksilver in living form, moving with such speed and grace that your enemies have no hope of pinning you down. Whether you fight alone or in the company of others who also race through the heat of battle, your enemies name you the quicksilver demon, never knowing where you will strike next.",
