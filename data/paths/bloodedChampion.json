    "text": "Your skill and discipline in battle have launched you into the warrior caste of minotaur society. By mastering your natural weapons and your other combat skills, you have transformed yourself into a living weapon. In searching yourself, you have melded opposing spiritual forces into a finely honed machine of war. The thrill of the fight flows through you, but you temper the impulse to give in to savagery. You know that a tainted body, mind, and soul wait at the end of that road. To you, every contest challenges your resolve and focuses your mind toward absolute control over yourself and your situation.",
