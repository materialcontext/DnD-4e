    "text": "In the depths of the Howling Forest lies a realm of wonder and magic—the eladrin city of Shinaelestra, the legendary City of Rangers. Each night Shinaelestra shifts silently across the veil separating the Feywild from the mortal world. It appears in the forest depths for a few hours before fading back to the Feywild at sunrise. The feral monsters and savage humanoids haunting the Howling Forest have learned to give the eladrin city a wide berth, for each night the guardians of Shinaelestra range far over the twisted paths and shadowed dells in search of evil’s servants.",
