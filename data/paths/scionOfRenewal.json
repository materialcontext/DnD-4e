    "text": "One of most ancient of shamanistic practices focuses on the river of renewal, an ancient, all-encompassing flow of spiritual energy that protects living things and allows them to heal. Tribal elders invoke the river of renewal to cleanse plagues, grow crops destroyed by pestilence, and help close the wounds of war. No sickness exists that this powerful energy cannot cure. Many shamans who strive to end suffering and bring healing to their people seek to be bathed in the spirits of the river.",
