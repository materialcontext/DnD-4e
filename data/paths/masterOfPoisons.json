Yet to whom do the mighty and the wealthy turn when they are in need of discreet murder? You, of course, and you’re happy to oblige. You never advertise your talents; it wouldn’t do for word to spread about your skills. Through prudent inquiries, people in need have a way of finding you. No problem is too big or well protected for your techniques to work, assuming you have enough time and your client has enough gold.",
