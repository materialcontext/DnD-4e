    "text": "Your choice to swear a pact to an infernal entity in exchange for power was not an easy choice, but it was a choice you made with open eyes. You understand the moral dangers implicit in your pact, but you believe that your soul can withstand the physical and mental forces of Hell. Though devils constantly attempt to lure you into their sinister plots, you remain steadfast against their persuasion.<br/>When an opportunity came to claim even more strength from your devilish patrons, you leaped at it. You accepted their empowering flames, wearing your might like a crown. Sometimes your allies worry about the ultimate fate of your soul, but you laugh off their concern. You assure them that you are in no danger, and that they need not pity you. However, you have heard the call of darkness, and sometimes you question what destination awaits you when you die.",
