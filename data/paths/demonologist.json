When you look into the eye of the Abyss, you have no doubt in your mind that you can learn to master it—one demon at a time, if need be.<br/> You have never shrunk from looking into shady places to serve your ambition. The longer you peer into darkness, the more certain you become that the secret to overwhelming power is hidden in the Abyss.  <br/> As a consequence of your studies, you have gained the attention of a minor demon—a filthy quasit. Discussions with this companion have expanded your mind to grim new possibilities. At the same time, the lessons have dissipated any reservations that perhaps you have gone too far. The more you learn from this quasit, the greater the power you control. Thus far, you have blithely ignored a nagging suspicion that somehow things might go terribly wrong.",
