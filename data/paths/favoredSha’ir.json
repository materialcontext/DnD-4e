    "text": "Your rapport with the elemental powers has grown to such a degree that they regard you as one of their own. Throughout the heroic tier, you established yourself as an able partner, ally, and, perhaps, servant of the elemental powers and in doing so earned greater and greater elemental rewards, including advanced arcane knowledge and more powerful spells. So armed, you stand ready to face even greater threats and reap even greater rewards.<br/> The elemental powers’ favor grants you deeper insights into elemental magic. Not only can your gen servant fetch potent spells, but you can pierce the barriers between the planes to draw forth power to serve your needs. Such command over creation’s fundamental forces translates into an improved gen servant that, at your command, can manifest the Elemental Chaos’s unruly energies in effective and dangerous ways. Not only does your gen servant improve, but when you master all the elemental gifts, you can transform your servant into a powerful elemental monolith.",
