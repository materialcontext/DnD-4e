As a loyal member of your chosen deity, you have already learned skills that make you a prime candidate for taking on the mantle of covenant agent. How you got to this point varies and is based on your religion’s structure (or lack thereof ), and what goals you accomplish in the name of your god can also vary greatly from any other covenant agent’s goals.",
