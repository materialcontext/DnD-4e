    "text": "The primal power you wield has formed a bond between you and the natural creatures of the world. In their myriad forms, you see fractured reflections of a greater being: the Primal Beast, who was the world’s first predator. All the hunting animals of the world—mighty lions and howling wolves, lowly ferrets and soaring eagles—hold a distant echo of the Primal Beast in their hearts.<br/>In your commitment to protect the world from demons, aberrations, and other beings that would corrupt the balance of nature, you find yourself growing closer to the Primal Beast’s perfection. That growth is reflected in your bloodwrath—the heightened speed you gain when you adopt a guardian form, and the fury that punishes the enemies you mark. At the pinnacle of your path, you at last gain the ability to take on the form of the Primal Beast.",
