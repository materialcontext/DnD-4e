    "text": "You might have trained at a fighting school or served in a military outfit, but you found all that discipline and all that rigorous training unnecessary. You see no finesse in swinging an axe. You hit someone and they fall. If they don’t fall, you’re doing it wrong—a problem corrected by just hitting them harder next time. Some warriors sneer at you, dismissing your accomplishments as luck, but the veterans know the truth: You are a killing machine. That’s why they call you the siegebreaker. Oh, not because you are good at driving enemies off, but because you are damn good at punching holes through your enemies’ defenses and bringing stalemates to sudden, bloody ends.",
