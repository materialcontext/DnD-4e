    "text": "Death and decay are as much part of nature as is birth and life. For the new to awaken in the world, the old must pass away. Although many druids champion life and a healthy wild, a few darkened souls embrace nature’s darker side, immersing themselves in the grim necessity that plays just as an important part in the natural cycle as does birth. Like other druids, they fiercely protect the spirits and the wild from harm, but they use nature’s darkest elements as weapons against their enemies.<br/>In becoming a blightbeast, you identify with these sinister elements and come to embody death. The power you use might manifest in your humanoid appearance. Or you might hide your kinship to death until you assume your beast form, at which point your true nature is revealed.<br/>You might be a coldhearted killer. Instead, you could use your newfound power to make room for new life. You can use your evocations to destroy those who threaten nature’s splendor, or commit yourself to wiping out the enemies of the natural order. Your powers are as useful against unnatural and natural creatures alike.",
