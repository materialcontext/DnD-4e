    "text": "The elite hunters of the Moonrise Vanguard live for the chase. Once a seeker engages its prey, she does not return until one of them is captured or dead. Defeating the enemy, however, is not the only goal. The seekers savor the pursuit, hounding their quarry with cunning and style.<br/> Drawing their power from the primal magic of the veil, the Moonrise seekers dispatch their opponents into the Feywild with the aid of the lunar spirits. In service to the Maiden of the Moon, these seekers try to keep their enemies off balance, using powers such as lunar transposition and echoing shot to rearrange the battlefield as they see fit.",
