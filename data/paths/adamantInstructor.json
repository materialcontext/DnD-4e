    "text": "The Great Teacher was revered by all the peoples of his underground realm. The ancient adamantine dragon’s influence didn’t spread into the land of sun and wind, but in the rock, ore, and fungus of the Underdark, his benevolence erected an island of good under the earth. Long ago, the Great Teacher rescued a group of dragonborn that that were beset by denizens of the Underdark, and instead of returning to the surface, these dragonborn devoted themselves to the Adamantine. They became his Adamant Instructors and together they forged a noble nation around the Great Teacher’s hoard in the cavern complex they called Adamanth. The dragonborn prospered under the Teacher’s guidance, and Adamanth became a haven for all that was good and strong. Even some drow and duergar were drawn by the Great Teacher’s benevolence to renounce their darker ways and live in peace under the rule of the Adamant Instructors.",
