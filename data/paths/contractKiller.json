You know your job and you do it well, without fuss, without mess. As a result, your employers return time and time again.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of rogues and assassins become contract killers. They take to this path because it provides a steady revenue stream while indulging their talents and inclinations.
