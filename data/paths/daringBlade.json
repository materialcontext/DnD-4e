    "text": "In the right hands, a blade is every bit the instrument a mandolin can be. As a bard, your ability to perform, to captivate audiences with song or story, is key. Through your tales or music, allies find new inspiration, while enemies find despair. You can clarify situations with your bold insights or muddy your foes’ senses with mocking wit and subterfuge. Just as this is possible through a bard’s music, so it is possible through other venues of performance.",
