    "text": "Life is too short to take seriously. Danger lurks in every shadow, and an enemy waits behind every door. Those who spend every waking moment thinking about all the bad things that could happen never leave the house.<br/> Instead of wringing your hands, you throw away all your worries and take a devil-may-care attitude. Sure, some say you will end up raking the coals of the Nine Hells because of your decadent living. In the end, though, who’s the happier: you and your adventurous, libertine ways or the hidebound drudge shuddering under his covers?<br/> On one hand, you’re a charmer. Others find your infectious wit and bravado winsome. But you’re also irreverent, irresponsible, and reckless. What’s worst is that sometimes you have the hardest time keeping your mouth shut. Whether cracking a joke in the middle of a solemn funeral or shouting a barrage of insults at a demon, you can’t help but stir up trouble. Deep down, you know life might be easier if you straightened up, but where’s the fun in that?<br/> When you face a serious challenge, your skill with weapons comes to the fore. Your tongue and your body language become secondary instruments of derision. You seed your exploits with cutting insults and disdain, goading your enemies into overextending or making other mistakes. When an enemy gives you an opening, you press the advantage. In the end, you stand triumphantly over a fallen foe, showing once again who the greater fool is.",
