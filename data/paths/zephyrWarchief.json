    "text": "You have mastered the art of war as practiced by the desert nomads. You are an expert at using speed and hit-and-run tactics for skirmishes and raids. Perhaps you are displaced from your original band, a grizzled veteran who now fights in foreign lands. You might be searching for a new band to lead or seeking to whip an existing group into shape. You could have been exiled from your tribe and now live as a rootless wanderer. Regardless of your past, your life brought you into contact with the ways of war, and from that experience, you became an aggressive and resourceful leader.",
