    "text": "You have infiltrated a demon cult known as the Fraternity of Tharos in hopes of eventually destroying it and restoring a measure of hope to the beleaguered land of Impiltur. Youâ€™ve had to perform a vile rite involving innocent sacrifice to enter the cult, and the stain of that deed only fuels your hatred of their existence. You have sworn one day to avenge all those who have suffered by the hands of the cult, and by doing so, you hope it will exonerate your own dark past.<br/> Using a combination of guile and infernal knowledge, you provide inside information for any adventuring group you join, chipping slowly away at the Fraternity and stopping their vile plots while keeping your cover intact.",
