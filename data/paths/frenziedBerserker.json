    "text": "The devastation of the thunderstorm howls in your soul, wild and untamed. You thrill in the chaos of battle, your wrath unquenched and uncontrollable. Battle, for you, is not a means to an end; it is an end in itself. The thrill of combat draws you on, and wounds only drive you to greater frenzy.<br/>Caught in the tumult of your anger, you must attack—calculated maneuvers and intricate strategies are diversions. You attack with sweeping blows that cleave through your enemies or lock single foes in deadly exchanges that can end only in the death of one or the other of you. When the furor of battle seizes you, you ignore pain and keep fighting when others would fall, an unconquerable whirlwind of destruction.",
