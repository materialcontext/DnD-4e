    "text": "You haven’t been through Hell. Not yet.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since you joined the Circle of Smoke and Whispers, the Hells have been trying to work through you instead. With countless painstaking maneuvers, through endless waves of vicious engagements, you have driven them back each time. If even a fraction of your sacrifices were known, they would move the most hardened veteran to tears. Secrecy is part of the price you pay to do what you do so well. You don’t claim the honor of your victories or boast of your accomplishments; you can’t mourn for fallen friends either or pay the tribute due them. Only the Circle of Smoke and Whispers knows your worth and your burdens. In the world you’ve sworn to protect, through the people who depend on you, you walk unseen and anonymous.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this you emulate generations of your predecessors. You have studied and mastered the tenets that grant your success. You watch from the background, strike from the shadows, and disappear without a trace after you eliminate a threat. The Vigil remains; you keep it. Thanks to your dedication, a safer and brighter day will dawn soon.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you’ve been through Hell, though, the world will know it.",
