    "text": "You have mastered the form of the coiled serpent, a sleek, stealthy beast form that carries the promise of pain and poison for your enemies. Some druids keep their distance from serpentine beasts, but you recognize such creatures as being just as integral to the natural world as anything that has fur or feathers. You call on cold-eyed serpent spirits, and your connection to the cobra, the adder, and the python gives you a subtle magic.",
