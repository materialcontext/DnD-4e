    "text": "A connection to the earth defines dwarves as a connection to woodlands defines elves. All dwarves intuitively heed the earth’s example, from the sustenance and riches it provides to the inexorable might of the landslide it spawns. Dwarf bodies are durable; more than once they’ve been compared to the dirt and stone that dwarves treasure. Any would-be dwarf hero does well to take advantage of this natural sturdiness.<br/> Innate toughness is a hallmark of dwarf soldiers and their leaders. Vigor makes for a soldier who can outlast the enemy by withstanding hardship and injury. A robust officer pushes troops onward not only with words, but also by determined example. Dwarf warriors are renowned for their endurance.<br/> Bergrom Earthfast, a dwarf general of legend, exemplifies the ideal dwarf warlord. Mighty in body and mind, Bergrom led his troops against giants before dwarves became free from the slavery of the titans. He endured supernatural elements, fell magic, and the treacherous wilds of old to help bring freedom to his people. His legacy endures in a martial tradition that values a sturdy body and the ability to get one’s allies to make the most of their own endurance, as much as it does tactical acumen. Although Bergrom was a dwarf and relied on dwarven resilience, his techniques have spread to other peoples. Anyone who values toughness and spirit in a soldier might learn these ancient methods.<br/> You are such a leader. Even if you didn’t acquire formal training in Bergrom’s leadership approach—or aren’t a dwarf—your talents have led you in a similar direction. Relying on a hardy constitution and heavy weapons as tools, you help your allies push the limits of mortal endurance. Your enemies are hard pressed to keep up.",
