    "text": "Some mithral dragons are content to spend their lives in the Astral Sea, having no connection to the world or the business of mortal creatures. That is not true of the Mithral Pentad, a band of five mithral dragons who believe it is Ioâ€™s will to rid the world of the tyranny wrought by their chromatic brethren. The Pentad seeks to eradicate any nation controlled by evil dragons, but they also strive to wipe out individual chromatics and their hoards to prevent any future injustice. Rarely, a metallic dragon might have vile plans that indicate its evil, but the Pentad seeks to convert them to the will of Io before killing them outright. If they refused to be turned, however, then the life of a copper or a mercury dragon is as forfeit as a red or black.",
