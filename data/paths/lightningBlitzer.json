    "text": "You grew up in a tribe that valued speed in battle, to the point that none would wear any armor heavier than a leather vest, or perhaps a hide cuirass. When you came of age, you saw the downsides of this strategy. Swift warriors found that their enemies’ blades were just a little swifter. You challenged the orthodoxy of the tribe, favoring heavier and heavier armor. Your tribe mocked you, for with your protection, you found you could no longer keep up with the rest of the tribe in battle and would inevitably fall behind your comrades as they claimed glory. Some murmured that you wore the armor so that you would not have to fight and risk your life.",
