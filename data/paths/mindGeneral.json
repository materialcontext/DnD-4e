    "text": "In the interest of protecting the city-states, the sorcerer-kings allow noble families to keep small armies of slave soldiers. Frequently, they use these soldiers to take action against other nobles or to protect their property. A sorcerer-king can, of course, call upon the nobles’ soldiers to fight for his or her interests. And it’s best to follow the sorcerer-king’s commands.<br/> As one of your duties to your family, you were given charge of a legion of slave soldiers. You trained with them, developing your psionic talents so you could command them silently. (Though sometimes shouted commands and threats can intimidate your enemies far better than eerie silence.) The most skilled mind generals can keep up a continuous mental link, sharing sights and combat instincts with all the troops in the legion.",
