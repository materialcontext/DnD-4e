    "text": "Not all that lived in the western Great Rift perished during the calamity that resulted in the creation of the Underchasm. Some managed to survive in small, isolated groups by keeping themselves one step ahead of the drow and other Underdark horrors that prowl the depths. Vowing to defend their heritage at all costs, many of these deep earth dwellers made pacts of power to keep their kind safe and strike back at the creeping evils on the edges of their enclaves. You have chosen this path, becoming a stalwart protector of your kind, but it was not without sacrifice that you came to your power.<br/>You have emerged from the depths of the Underchasm and have seen and heard terrible things that few others have experienced firsthand. Your dark connection to entities beyond this world has steeled your resolve to fight against the enemies of your people, and your bond with the earth is unbreakable.You serve as a valuable guide when your group heads underground, but you’re also a very capable protector when the time comes to fight, steeled by years of a harsh, lightless existence.",
