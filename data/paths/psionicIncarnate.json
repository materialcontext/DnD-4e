    "text": "The Awakening opened your mind to new possibilities, aiding you in the acquisition and use of psionics. To achieve your present power, you sacrificed the body to which you were born. But even though the replacement contains none of the flaws of that first vessel, this new form is no longer suitable to hold the perfection that is your mind. The power you have gained over the course of your adventures is working to reshape you once again.<br/> The body that is the temple of your psionic power grows ever more resilient. You respond to the worst injuries by steeling yourself in preparation for more. Hunger and thirst become dim memories as your need for such crude nourishment passes. You find sleep unnecessary, outgrowing this last lingering connection to your mortal life. The physical perfection of your new form serves your mind at the highest level. You are the living incarnation of psionic power, and your body now reflects your mastery of that power.",
