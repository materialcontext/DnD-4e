    "text": "Death frees souls from the concerns of life, but some wrongs the departed remember—even if the mind has long rotted away. You’re the ghost of a life you barely recall; yet, you can’t forget what they did. And you won’t forgive it either. Some power put you back in this world, and whether or not it did so for this reason, you’re out for revenge. Of course, those who wronged you in the past aren’t the only ones on your hit list. You received a second chance, and this time you’re not letting anything slide.<br/>With each enemy you bury, you feel a little hollower. The cold rage gives way to a numbing chill, and life—your previous one and the half-life you now lead—slips quietly away into oblivion. Still, what difference does it make? You’re already dead.",
