    "text": "Ameth’s closest friend and advisor, Sot-Olmat, pioneered a discipline of rigorous mastery over the elements within a genasi. It is a discipline that one can master through a combination of meditation on a simple mantra and a series of exercises that look harmless but serve to unlock elemental potential within the genasi. The mantra is a repetition in Primordial regarding one’s elemental affinity: “Fire cannot be chained,” or “Water cannot be chained.” Some manifestations require the mantra be changed: “Earth is not chained; earth is the chain.” “Acid consumes all chains.” Sot-Olmat developed this path while a slave, and he continues to expose himself to danger to teach the rudiments of it to other enslaved genasi.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A genasi who studies this discipline becomes impossible to bind or cage. He or she can escape bonds of all sorts swiftly, becoming a master of escape artistry through the mastery of the elemental nature innate to every genasi.",
