    "text": "In carrying out the orders of Zehir’s high priests without fail, you have conveyed many souls to the dark god’s maw and earned great honor. Now, by replacing a portion of your soul with the darkness he commands, Zehir marks you as a worthy servant and transforms you into one of his blessed fangs. You have fought fiercely for this accolade, and members of the Third Coil accord you the respect you have earned as one of Zehir’s most zealous servants.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a fang of Zehir, your overriding concern is feeding as many souls as possible to your god. You are a holy slayer, dispatched on special missions by Zehir and his high priests. As a reward for your faith, Zehir will alter your mind and body to reflect his glory. It is said that the most faithful of the fangs of Zehir eventually shed their warm-blooded forms altogether, becoming living reflections of their divine master.",
