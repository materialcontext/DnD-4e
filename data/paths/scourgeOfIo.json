    "text": "Many of the gods harbor a special hatred for dragons, or at least those dragons who do not share their alignment<br/>and worldview. They have not forgotten Ioâ€™s arrogance, his refusal to work alongside them in their battle against the Primordials. As such, when a cleric devotes herself to battling these monstrous creatures, many of the gods have provided ceremonies and rites to imbue that cleric with extra powers. When you use your Scourge of Io powers, your eyes briefly take on slitted pupils and a gleam of inner power.",
