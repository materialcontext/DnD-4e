    "text": "Arcane magic demands much of those who would master it. It consumes time and attention. A disciplined mind is needed to bend raw energy into useful spells. Many arcane users find that the power they attain through this pursuit is sufficient: its rewards are great and the secrets unlocked are astonishing. A taste of power leads some to look beyond their dusty tomes and ritual circles to turn their power toward temporal gains. Arcanists prove capable, if not devastating, in battle, and those who dabble in leadership, commanding servants and powers beyond comprehension, prove to be some of the deadliest warlords of all.<br/> Marrying power drawn from your pact with the martial techniques used by a warlord, you become a commanding presence on the battlefield. You twist your spells to confound your enemies while helping allies attain the best positions they can to meet the battleâ€™s demands. Even when your foes thwart your clever plans, you have a knack for finding solutions to the thorniest problems.",
