You have tempered your warlock pact by communion with the ancient powers that dwell in the forests of the eladrin home island. The<br/>spirits of Evermeet have the most to offer to warlocks who are already bound to other fey (those of the fey pact), but any warlock, regardless of his or her pact, can discover advantages of allying with Evermeetâ€™s pact-makers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The almost-forgotten, gossamer spirits of Evermeet offer great boons to those who call upon their secret names, which have not been uttered by mortal lips for millennia. The fey of Evermeet move freely to  and from the Feywild. With their aid you can wield powers that mere mortals were not meant to wield.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are a light against the blackness, a beacon of hope in the coldest depths of night.",
