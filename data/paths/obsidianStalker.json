    "text": "You are a hunting phantom, an assassin who excels at using shadow magic to slip past the tightest defenses. Once you have chosen to slay a creature, no barrier can prevent you from reaching it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>This assassin’s tradition traces its origin to the Obsidian Cave assassins’ guild, an ancient dwarven order that specialized in hunting down and killing Underdark monsters. Initiates of the Obsidian Cave were tasked with finding and killing mind flayers, drow priestesses, and others that sought to attack the surface world. With such preventative attacks, the dwarves ensured that their mines remained safe. Since that time, the hunting phantom’s techniques have passed to assassins from different traditions.",
