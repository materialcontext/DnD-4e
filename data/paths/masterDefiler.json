    "text": "The lowly and the ignorant see defilers as craven and corrupt—little more than thieves with magical talent. It’s true that the defiler’s path is selfish in its way: A defiler requires energy from associates and the living world nearby to power his or her greatest spells. And it is also true is that defiling can corrupt the body and mind. But only a fool could fail to see the power that defiling offers, and you are not a fool.",
