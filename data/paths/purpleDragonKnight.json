    "text": "You live only to serve the Crown of Cormyr and defend its people from the menacing evils of the world. Cormyr’s  armies are thick with pikes and blades, but you are among the finest in the nation’s mighty military machine. Evil is everywhere, preying on those who cannot defend themselves, but you are the sword and shield that stand for justice.<br/> As a knight of Cormyr, your honor is everything. You do not bend it, for to do so would sully the memory of your fallen comrades. You do not compromise with evil, nor can you ignore it as so many people do every day. Your oath is to combat iniquity, avarice, and wickedness wherever they rear their ugly heads. Wherever cruelty and sin fester, wherever corruption takes hold, and wherever enemies of your great kingdom thrive is where you are needed most.<br/> Your training is second to none, and your fierce determination has seen you through death’s door and back again on more than one occasion. You cultivate martial prowess that far exceeds that of your foes, but this is not your greatest strength. Your most impressive skill is as a commander on the battlefield. You are an anointed knight, and a born leader whose presence inspires those who share your worthy cause.",
