    "text": "Divine wrath can manifest as punishing blasts of radiant light, as fire from the heavens, or as thunder and lightning that smite the gods’ foes. Sometimes, though, the gods’ anger is manifested in plagues and curses upon the wicked. Even good deities can resort to extreme methods to purge the world of corruption.<br/>As a blightspeaker, you wield such extreme methods in your god’s name. Like an angel of death, you wield the scythe of necrotic power and harvest life from your enemies to fuel your own strength. To the common folk, you are a frightful presence, a grim reminder of your god’s darker side. To your enemies, you are a terror, a manifestation of the judgment that has been pronounced upon them and of the punishment that awaits.",
