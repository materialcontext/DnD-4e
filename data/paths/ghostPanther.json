    "text": "The mystery of the primal stalker is that death is a constant presence in the midst of life; the death of the prey brings life to the predator. And when death comes to the predator, it brings life to scavengers and carrion feeders. Death is part of the great wheel of mortal existence, and an important part of the shamanâ€™s communion with the spirit world.<br/>As a shaman, you have always walked close to death. Now you have set out on the path of the ghost panther, where life and death twine together still closer. You stalk the wild, hiding from your prey, leaping and climbing like the most agile of cats. You call on panther spirits to attack your foes, weaken your prey, help you leap away from enemy attacks, and lead you through the spirit world to teleport adjacent to your foes.",
