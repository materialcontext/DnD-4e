    "text": "Your vampire heritage has served only to make you a stronger warrior. It could be that you grew up in a vampire clan, and were shaped and honed into a perfect weapon for their aims. Several like you have such a history. Or maybe you’ve listened to your blood’s whispers, gaining supernatural talents as a reward for your efforts. The blood of your enemies cries out to your own. You sense those you have marked for death like a wolf smell’s fear in the hunted. Your adversaries are your prey, to be driven where you wish and ultimately struck down to supplement your strength.",
