    "text": "You are an agent of justice to your deity’s enemies. You are judge, jury, and executioner, although you are more than an inflicter of punishment. You are also a redresser of wrongs and a giver of absolution, enjoined to aid those who have been unfairly treated and to set injustices aright. According to longstanding tradition, you conceal your features beneath a crimson mask or hood while you perform your duties. By this sign the condemned and the forgiven alike know that you are acting not from your mortal passions or preferences, but as your divine master instructs. Crimson arbiters are most likely to serve deities concerned with law or justice, such as Erathis, Bahamut, Pelor, or Bane.",
