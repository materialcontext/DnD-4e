    "text": "You are part of an unusual group of thieves. You are a member of House Kundarak’s Ghorad’din, who are charged with testing the house’s wards and recovering property stolen by those brazen enough to break into Kundarak vaults. You combine the magical prowess of a spellcaster with the stealth of a burglar. As a result, no barrier can stop you.<br/>House Kundarak uses the Ghorad’din only rarely, and they answer only to Lord Morrikan, leader of House Kundarak. When a new high security vault needs testing, the house assembles a group of Ghorad’din to try to break in and expose weaknesses before any treasure is placed within. Although such practices hone your skills, you might prefer even greater challenges. The most skilled Ghorad’din are assigned to recover stolen property from other gifted thieves. Whispers also tell of Ghorad’din who operate as assassins.",
