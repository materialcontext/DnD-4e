They possess minds bursting with energy, looking for release.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and greatest expression of the link with your totem creature is the manifestation of a spiriteye. This weapon resembles nothing more than a ghostly eye which f loats in front of the ocular adept. Despite its appearance, a seeker can use some of the principles learned with a mundane ranged weapons to fight with the spiriteye. It takes intense concentration and manipulation of the psionic and primal magics to create the spiriteye, but in time, the ocular adept gains mastery of the weapon and can control it with thought alone.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the eye tyrant, you can make several swift attacks at range and f loat across the battlefield to a safer location. Attacks made with your spiriteye resemble the beholderâ€™s dreaded eye rays, and you have the same variety of effects with them (albeit with less control).",
