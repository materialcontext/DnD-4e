These few can access a shard of Pluton—a domain of the restless dead unclaimed by the Raven Queen—and bend it to their will. For a true worshiper of Nerull, few higher rewards exist.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a soul binder, you have bound a soul to your service. The soul might be that of an enemy whose torment you wish to prolong, a loved one whose company you wish to keep, or a friend whom you’re saving from a vile afterlife. Regardless of your reasons, the soul must protect and serve you.",
