    "text": "The basilisk is renowned for its hunting prowess, and its pitiless gaze. Inspired by both the basilisk’s sinuous movements and the immobilizing effect of its gaze, a group of monks have developed disciplines that mirror this creature’s fearsome reputation.<br/> Your study of the basilisk’s fury has opened your mind to the emotions around and in you. Achieving this state empties your body of thought and draws the sensations of others through your eyes. Foes that peer into your obsidian gaze are drained of hope. All that remains for your enemy are apathy, stasis, and death.",
