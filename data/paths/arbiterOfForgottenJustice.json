    "text": "Some invokers have learned to harness Amoth’s lingering might by using the powers presented, but a few—a rare but growing few—have gone further. They have devoted themselves in full to Amoth, spreading justice in his memory and drawing at least in part on his own surviving might to do so. <br/>You are one of these select few. Whether you have dedicated yourself exclusively to Amoth’s teachings, or serve other gods of justice in memory of Amoth, you draw upon the lingering energy of the murdered Lord of Kalandurren. As an arbiter of forgotten justice, you know that one must deal with the evils that plague mortals and gods alike. Their crimes must be punished—from simple human greed to the murder of Amoth.",
