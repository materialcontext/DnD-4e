    "text": "Although knowledge and training are great virtues, sometimes such expertise acts as a barrier. Knowledge can breed complacency, blinding an individual to a better path. As an individual specializes, time spent gaining a deeper understanding of the chosen specialty is time not used to expand his or her knowledge in other areas. Too much focus can narrow the vision.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than bind yourself to one pursuit and one belief, you expand your mind and reject your assumptions. In doing so, you find new possibilities to explore. The lessons you learn help you overcome different challenges and hardships, and they allow you to adapt to whatever situation you face.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liberation you enjoy can also extend to your companions. Reaching into their minds, you stir their true selves, shaking them free from the expectations that bind them. No doubts or fears hold them back. They are free to strive harder and to push past limitations their expertise places on them. You are their catalyst, and with a mere mental touch, you effect a transformation to help them become what they were meant to be.",
