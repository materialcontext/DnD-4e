Through the world’s many changes, one story remains eternal: Selûne’s vigilant opposition to the machinations of her dark sister, Shar. Silverstars carry the light and hope of their goddess into the darkness, championing causes others think lost. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike many of the other gods and goddesses, Selûne is willing to share some of her power with worshipers who are not solely devoted to studying her will. Wizards, warlocks, bards, and sorcerers can become silverstars of note.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Spellplague, Selûne’s mortal concerns often centered on lycanthropes: werewolves, wereboars, werebears and other worshipers who could change into animal shapes governed by the moon. After the  Spellplague, lycanthropy spiraled beyond Selûne’s benevolent control. She does what she can for its victims, but sometimes all she can do is offer a swift silver blade.",
