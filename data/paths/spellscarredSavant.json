    "text": "Since the Spellplague struck, all manner of terrible abominations have spread across the face of Toril. Creatures  that have spellscars riddle the world now, sowing madness and fear wherever they appear. To a select few, though, the spellscar that mars their flesh is no curse, but rather a powerful boon. You are one of these few, a spellscarred savant. You wear your scar as a badge of power and a fell warning to your foes.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have learned to harness the dark gift of your spellscar and channel its disrupting power. The erratic forces behind your spellscar are yours to command now. Your mastery of your spellscar allows you to tap into the raw magical energy known as spellfire, either to heal yourself with its sizzling power or invigorate your body in combat. As your power grows, you can wield the fury of spellfire as easily as a warrior does a blade, calling down the untempered essence of magic gone mad to burn foes to ash.",
