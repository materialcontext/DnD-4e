    "text": "Many avengers find themselves confronting some great threat, such as a group of drow seeking to enslave a surface kingdom, an incursion of demons, a cult of Tharizdun worshipers, or an empire of vampires secretly ruling over human cities. Whatever the threat might be, it is dire enough to drive you to an old and powerful rite of sacred commitment. Through prayerful vigils, you have invested your oath of enmity with tremendous potency. All avengers rely on oath of enmity, but you draw on yours to perform exceptional feats in battle.",
