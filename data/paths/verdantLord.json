    "text": "Like the trees of the forest, you draw strength from the loamy earth, from the water that spills from the sky and flows across the land, and from the radiance of the sun. You embrace the essence of the tree, becoming the forestâ€™s protector, its champion against those that would despoil it. When you use your primal powers, shoots of new growth emerge from the ground, flowers bloom, and trees straighten with renewed vigor.<br/>You favor guardian form powers that let you take on treelike forms (such as form of the willow sentinel, form of the oak sentinel, and form of the rowan sentinel), but even when you take on other aspects, the earth responds with growth. As the culmination of this path, you can take on a form like that of a treant, smashing foes and objects alike with a weapon held in your branchlike fists.",
