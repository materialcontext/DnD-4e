    "text": "From time to time, the Raven Queen’s gaze lingers on a mortal soul whose courage and devotion sparks her cold heart. To these mortals she sends a special boon—a raven-shaped shadow whose appearance is a sign of her favor.<br/> Those who gain this blessing are known as ravenkin, and from that point on they are never truly alone. The shadow raven that keeps them company is a physical connection to the god of death. Devout worshipers of the Raven Queen are the most common ravenkin. However, some ravenkin are recent converts to her faith, unsure of what they have done to warrant such a gift.<br/> Since the blessing that marked you as a ravenkin, you have been aware that you are watched by the Raven Queen. Some might grow uneasy under such scrutiny, but you embrace it, knowing that you have a special place in the god’s plans.",
