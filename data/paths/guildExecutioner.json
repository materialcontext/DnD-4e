    "text": "Executioners who reach the paragon tier have proven themselves more than capable of carrying out assassinations (both clandestine and public) without being caught or killed themselves. For you, simple political assassinations and hired killings begin to lose their luster, because city watchmen or the bodyguards of local merchants rarely challenge your skills. Your abilities are better utilized stalking more powerful quarry—those that threaten the entire world, if not the planes themselves.",
