    "text": "At 11th level, your redeemed deva takes on the dark star paragon path. Freeing oneself from corruption is no guarantee against returning to evil, and no one knows this better than does the fallen deva. Reclaiming your deva form does nothing to dispel those memories and experiences from your time as rakshasa. The wicked memories lurk in your thoughts, urging you to indulge in deviant acts, to embrace vice and wickedness, and to succumb to evil’s temptation once more.<br/> Your dark memories haunt you. Try as you might, you cannot silence the voices nor can you suppress the experiences you found in your fallen state. As you were once able, you can still call upon the memories you carry to aid you, but in addition to the other deva lifetimes, you also can draw upon your time as rakshasa as well. Drawing from these recollections places you at risk of falling once more, but provided you remain fixed toward your path, perhaps one day you will overcome the shame you must shoulder.<br/> Devas know their redeemed brethren as dark stars, so named for their new ascendancy toward virtue and also for the evil shadowing their souls. Devas are, of course, rare in the world and so dark stars are even rarer—so scarce most might believe them representative of the entire race. As a dark star, you must ever contend with your unpleasant memories while working to earn the redemption you have received.",
