    "text": "A tiefling with enough motivation and skill can purge the hereditary infernal magic of their bloodline and replace it with another. The prize demands a price, but a small one, because shifting the watered-down gifts of devils around the world is less arduous than it seems. Not all tieflings are satisfied to give up something at the core of their beingsâ€”even to replace it with something else. Those who are brave enough can take more without giving anything up. By taking more of this power, they can gather the might they need to found New Turath, or they can keep the power out of the hands of those who would dare such a dangerous blasphemy.",
