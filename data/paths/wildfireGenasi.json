You are the master of flame and smoke, reducing all who defy you to burnt cinders and piles of ash. Fire is a tame thing in your hands, dancing in your palm and answering to your every whim.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your igneous heritage grants you the power to hurl flames upon the enemy or shield your allies from the searing heat of Hell itself. You are the center of a constant whirlwind of fire, and anyone who dares attack you gets burned.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire is in your life’s blood, and though it destroys others, it grants you greater vitality. Pity those who must face you in combat, for they do not face a mortal foe, but rather the force of a volcano, with lava for blood and the promise of burning agony to any who raise their weapons against you.",
