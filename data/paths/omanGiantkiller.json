    "text": "You were trained by a clan of Northlanders who have developed specialized tactics for giantslaying. Although their purpose in training you was to aid them in liberating the isle of Oman, you’ve found that their techniques are very applicable to other enemies as well. In addition to learning how to effectively fight giants, the Northlanders taught you a bit about sailing and the sea.<br/> In a group, you stay out front, confounding your brutish enemies until you are ready to strike a killing blow. You are willing to take calculated risks to obtain advantage over your larger foes, and with enough support, you keep your enemies’ attention focused on you. It’s a challenge to go toe-to-toe with heavy hitters all the time, but it’s one you relish.",
