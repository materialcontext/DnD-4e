    "text": "In a small tome called Fey Pacts of Ancient Days, you discovered the names of ancient archfey once revered by primitive humans. The tome described Neifion the Lord of Bats, Zebechial the Lord of Lightning, and Morrisa the Lady of Swords.<br/>You were amazed and intrigued. You could feel a power within each name calling out to you. These ancient entities, so long forgotten, offered you strength in exchange for devotion.<br/>You eventually acquiesced, swearing yourself to the fey creature whose ethos you believed most matched your own: the Lord of Lightning. Now, the entity whispers secrets of the storm to you from his floating demesne within the Feywild. You listen carefully to each utterance, every growl of the storm or roar of lightning. Although the Lord of Lightning seems most concerned with unleashing the force of the storm, you have gained much power under his tutelage. It might be only a matter of time before your own spells rival the power of your master.",
