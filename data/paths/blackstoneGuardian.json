This vision has haunted you for as long as you can remember, but until now, you have struggled in vain to discover its meaning.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blackstone monolith has chosen you as its champion. In another age, noble champions of a distant land fought to contain a breach to the Far Realm. They sealed the rift with powerful psionic wards, behind elemental stone imbued with their own consciousness. Each generation, the wards they forged must be resealed by new champions. You are bound to the fate of the guardians you follow.",
