    "text": "Just as the gentlest wind stirs grains of sand when it travels, so too do disciples of the winds take an active role in the events and lives they come into contact with during their wanderings. As a disciple of the winds, you are a shaman of wind spirits, from the gentle breeze that brings summer’s warmth to the ferocious storm that scours the land, ripping trees from the earth. You particularly honor Stormhawk, and that spirit’s range of emotions and thirst for vengeance are the standard by which you measure your own actions.",
