    "text": "You are an initiate in a rare tradition, one that embraces a unified religious concept summed up in one word of power. The Word was crafted by the gods to be a great weapon. Only the most trustworthy and compassionate invokers are taught the syllables of the Word, and even they seldom use its power. Each syllable, when spoken in the proper pitch and cadence, is a powerful prayer in its own right, and those brief tones are the most powerful weapons of your faith.",
