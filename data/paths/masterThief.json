    "text": "To a thief in the paragon tier, mundane guardians, traps, and locks are the stuff of mockery. In any human or dwarven city, there are few items you could not have if you wanted them. Your attention now turns to far greater quarry: treasures lost to time, and riches sealed away by titans, demon lords, and worse.",
