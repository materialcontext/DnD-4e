When in doubt, you trust the dice to determine your actions. Just like the wind, you can be gentle and complacent or a dangerous storm capable of destroying those who stand in your way. Although you are always unpredictable, you can be a brave and loyal companion; fortune brought your company together, after all, and you know better than most that great deeds often flow from unlikely friendships or chance meetings.",
