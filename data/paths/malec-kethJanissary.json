    "text": "Malec-Keth janissaries are products of the elite arcane and military practices taught in the Tower of Malec-Keth, a war-magic academy in the City of Brass. Highly disciplined and rigorously trained, Malec-Keth janissaries have a fighting style demonstrative of their mastery of mind and body. They learn offensive and defensive techniques to protect their wards, and they also study music, art, and language.<br/> Many Malec-Keth janissaries are servants to powerful masters, both humanoid and elemental. Proud and loyal, janissaries are single-minded in defense of their allies and masters. They favor a modest appearance; the only distinguishing mark a janissary bears is the tattoo of single blue flame on the brow that declares him or her a graduate of Malec-Keth. Those who wear the mark of Malec-Keth are known far and wide among the elemental realms for their determination and deadly skill with spell and blade.<br/> Many powerful lords and ladies favor janissaries as bodyguards for their defensive abilities. Other Malec- Keth janissaries owe allegiance to no master, preferring to use their training to further their own ambitions.",
