    "text": "While the dragonborn suffered under the reign of the Empress Dragon of Skelkor, many were left adrift in the world, their families and homes taken from them without warning or care. Some of these dragonborn from the tribes at the fringes of civilization learned to awaken their latent magic and fuel their primal fury with arcane power. Becoming the scourge of dragons and their allies, these relentless warriors lived to bring down their prey. In time, they taught their secrets to tribes of other races that also suffered under draconic rule. You are one of their kind, a dragonfoe ragespell, a cauldron of rage and power set upon a mission to rid the world of the creatures that once enslaved your people.",
