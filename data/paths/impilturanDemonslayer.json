Now demons haunt its wilds, and every day more plaguechanged and spellscarred nightmares emerge from the Earthspur Mountains.<br/> As a demon slayer, you fearlessly hunt the foul abominations prowling your homeland. Demons are the stuff of most adventurers’ nightmares, but your training and fierce devotion to their destruction grants you the power to lay low these otherworldly horrors. You hunt demons as lesser rangers hunt wolves or bears, running these revolting monstrosities to ground and cutting them to pieces. Your death-dealing abilities even grant your allies the power to circumvent a demon’s prodigious defenses. Your twin blades are the bane of demons, cutting a swath through their foul legions and purging their dark influence from your once-great kingdom.",
