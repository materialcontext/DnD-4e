    "text": "Preservers of the Veiled Alliance lead the way for spellcasters everywhere, keeping the only honorable path of arcane power alive. And yet as powerful as they are, most of them need stalwart warriors to hold back the enemy while they work their magic. Protecting preservers is a duty of all who consider themselves members of the Veiled Alliance.<br/> You have taken this tenet to heart and become its embodiment. Involvement with preservers has taught you much. Your training with the Alliance has honed your skills so that you can disable any adversary. This practice might have even made you into a preserver proper, if you weren’t one before.<br/> Now you are an elite defender of the Alliance and its goals, an ideal example of the preserving way. You weave arcane power to give your allies the openings they need. So that you and your allies can succeed, you hinder the enemy with specialized techniques. Victory is sometimes defined as mere survival or a daring escape, but preventing enemies of the Alliance from doing harm or making their own getaway is even better. Few do that better than you.",
