You are the master of summoning, shaping the raw possibility of your psionic power into whatever form you desire. The servants you fashion are granted a semblance of life, which they sacrifice willingly to fight on your behalf. Your creations are many and varied. Your focus allows you to bestow a consistent range of traits that mark them all as your children, and that grant unequalled usefulness on the battlefield.",
