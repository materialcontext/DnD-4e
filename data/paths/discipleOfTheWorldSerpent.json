    "text": "The World Serpent, legend says, is among the greatest of the primal spirits that established the natural laws of the world and is one of the staunchest defenders of those laws. When a divine exarch and the servant of a primordial joined forces in an attempt to tamper with the natural order, the World Serpent simultaneously crushed the life from them both. The earth is said to rest in this mighty serpent’s coils, the motion of which shakes the ground.<br/>As a disciple of the World Serpent, you are charged with maintaining the balance of the natural order and ensuring that creatures from beyond the mortal realm keep to their place. You wield the World Serpent’s power, using it to pierce your foes with its fangs or crush them in its coils. Your spirit companion hinders the movement of your enemies as the World Serpent’s coils echo through the space around it. The World Serpent’s venom empowers your evocations, poisoning creatures that break free of your power.",
