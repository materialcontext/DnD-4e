    "text": "Like many swordmages, you can effortlessly travel the roads behind the world. Those arcane pathways offer you more than they do your fellows, though, for you have actually learned to slip through the space between planes.<br/>Your travels through the weave of reality have transformed your knowledge and skills. As you bend space with cunning strokes of your sword, you can be in two places at once, splitting your physical body between the dimensions. You might briefly take on the seeming of a ghostly spirit, but this appearance is only a temporary transformation. Even when you step between worlds, your blade doesn’t fade—remaining a very real threat to your enemies.<br/>Your eerie form has gained you the moniker of “ghost” in some circles. You smile to hear such nicknames, although they are untrue, because you knowthat fear is a valuable weapon.",
