    "text": "You are a renowned captain and a famous leader who is known for generosity toward your troops and ferocity in the face of enemies. You’re at your best with allies nearby, fighting back to back against a throng of worthy foes. You grew up in a culture that values camaraderie, honor, cooperation, and nobility. Dirty fighting, deceit, and trickery are anathema to you. You eschew these strategies in favor of sound tactics, strong morale, well-trained warriors, solid armor and weapons, and proper planning. You’re not afraid to get your hands dirty, though you believe that respect should be shown to friend and foe alike.",
