The primal spirits with whom you ally yourself guide your steps so that you can move without fear, boldly moving faster than your foes can track. You might use hidden pathways and shortcuts through the world. Or you might have taken your first step into the spirit world and, by doing so, now have the same freedom enjoyed by the land’s spirit custodians.",
