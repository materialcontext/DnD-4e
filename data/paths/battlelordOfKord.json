    "text": "Both Kord and Bane exult in battle. Bane sends his followers to conquer and pillage, using war for the sake of unjust gain, wanton violence, or sheer bloodlust. Kord’s way is one of accepting challenges as they come and using mastered talents to overcome them. His dogma is one of bravery, strength, and skill. No test of mortal mettle is stronger than the crucible of battle. The glory and fame that Kord admonishes his followers to seek involves striving to win the respect of their fellows for upholding their duty and facing danger with their heads held high.<br/> Warriors and warlords of all sorts esteem Kord. Those who know that fighting is sometimes necessary pray to Kord for favor, rather than to Bane. Such warriors know that it is the fate of a few to stand against senseless destruction and oppression. Kord’s followers do so without flinching. They uphold the right to independence that Kord’s wild nature demands. When battle is done, revelry, boasting, and toasting— celebrating life and health—are all that Kord requires as thanks.<br/> Numerous schools of military thought use Kord’s dogma as part of their philosophy. Leaders must be strong and courageous. They must hone their talents to assure victory and survival in bloody days. Renown should be earned through bold and decisive action that serves as an example to one’s comrades. A valiant warlord protects his fellow soldiers by leading from the front and luring in the enemy, as Kord did in older days.<br/> You are a leader who reveres Kord’s ways. As such, you have shaped your skills by leading your comrades against many dangers. With a war cry, you fearlessly engage your enemies. You stride among your adversaries, seeking the greatest among them and challenging them with your amazing exploits. Your brashness inspires your allies to decisive action and helps create the opportunities in which triumph can be secured.",
