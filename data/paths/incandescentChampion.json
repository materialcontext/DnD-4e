    "text": "Mortals might be flawed creations, given to error and misjudgment. But all mortals are blessed with a singular gift: the soul. Psionic energy revealed your soul’s power, and through long study and introspection, you learned to navigate the labyrinthine pathways of your being.<br/> This energy suffuses you and surrounds you in a radiant glow. Although you can dampen your inner light, you and others around you find its presence comforting. In time, the light responds to your commands, burning your enemies while bolstering your allies, or even allowing your soul to eclipse your body.<br/> The more you access your soul’s power, the more you understand that this essence must be guarded. Those who would exploit souls, twisting them for dark ends, and those who would hoard souls on their journey beyond the body must be destroyed and their prisoners freed. To this end, you commit yourself against the myriad villains who use or abuse souls.",
