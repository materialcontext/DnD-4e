    "text": "The wilderness is your home, and your connection to the primal spirits of the land grants you speed and ferocity. You move through the forest like a deer, and you charge into battle with the cheetahâ€™s speed and fury.<br/>The powers of a wildrunner emphasize mobility, letting you shift and move quickly while striking your foes. You pounce from foe to foe, avoiding opportunity attacks while dealing all the damage your rage can muster.<br/>Elf barbarians are frequently drawn to this paragon path, because its powers complement their natural mobility. Likewise, many rangers who nurture a connection to the primal forces of nature by taking barbarian multiclass feats find this path appealing.",
