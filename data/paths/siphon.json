    "text": "Not all vampires are undead, drinking the blood of the living or draining souls with a touch. Some feast on intense feelings such as fear and love, anger and happiness. They are insidious creatures—parasites that gorge without drawing attention to themselves. Some might not even realize what they’re doing. Regardless of whether a siphon is cognizant of his or her abilities, the effect of such a character’s power is palpable, as a victim falls into the clutches of lethargy, becoming torpid and drained.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a siphon, you use psionics to absorb thought energy from your victims, drinking deep from their emotions and feelings to increase your power. Your mind is a vortex, catching others’ thoughts and using them to replenish your resources and overcome your injuries. Once you establish a link with another creature, you can draw its energy until your prey is drained and unable to act. You might keep this energy for yourself or transfer it to your allies so that they can share its benefits.",
