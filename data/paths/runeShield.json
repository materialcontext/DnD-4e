    "text": "You see in the runes a strength greater than that of any mortal power, and you maintain a stern resolution to bring the power of the gods to bear on those who would threaten the world and the astral domains. The first rune of shielding remains carved into the stone at the heart of the world, where members of your order delved into the darkest shadows to defeat primordials of earth and lava. Someday you might make a pilgrimage to that sacred place, but until then you stand at the forefront of any battle. Your runes echo across the battlefield, scattering your foes and fortifying your allies.",
