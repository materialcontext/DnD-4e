    "text": "Arcane magic is a form of power wielded for purposes both benevolent and malevolent. There is nothing inherently good or evil about it. Its moral value depends on the purpose to which it is put. At least, that is usually the case.<br/>As a demonskin adept, you wield arcane power ripped from the depths of the Abyss, the home of demons. You incorporate the ritually treated skins of demons into your clothes and armor, and you use those skins to open conduits through which your spells are warped by the Abyss’s unutterable evil. Perhaps you believe that good ends justify evil means, but how long can you maintain your desire for good when you allow such evil to touch your soul? The power you wield is stolen, and the lords of the<br/>Abyss do not take kindly to being robbed. Although this path brings great power, it is power that comes at a sometimes terrible price. Count yourself lucky if the worst price you pay is your life.",
