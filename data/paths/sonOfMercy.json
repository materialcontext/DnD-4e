    "text": "Champions of order, law, and justice, Sons of Mercy are common sights on Sigil’s streets, but more and more, they range farther from the great city. They might take root in Astral dominions, raise citadels in the Feywild or Shadowfell, or found great bastions to combat lawlessness in the Elemental Chaos. They are symbols of order, champions of law who uphold justice wherever they travel. Sons of Mercy might be found among any group that splintered away from Sigil’s Mercykillers during the Faction War, not just the faction that still bears that name.<br/> You identify lawbreakers and fight to bring them to justice, whether that be swift execution or capture for questioning. You turn your attention to one target at a time and are single-minded in that pursuit, chasing down the fugitive until justice is served. Those who break the laws have good reason to fear you on the battlefield.",
