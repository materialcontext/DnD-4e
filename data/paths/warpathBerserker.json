    "text": "Tactics have their place. A cunning stratagem can give you and your fellows a decisive advantage in the opening forays, but slavish adherence to plans invites disaster. Circumstances change, and when they do, the best response is to do something your enemy would never expect.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You stand between two worlds. You have the knowledge and training of a field commander, but your military expertise is ever at odds with your reckless manner. You might devise some plan but abandon it quickly, giving in to your bloodlust and rage when circumstances change. When you do, your allies find your wrath infectious, the frenzy overtaking common sense as they smash through their opponents.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most powerful warpath berserkers come from bravura warlords and thaneborn barbarians. Wrath burns within you, seething in your heart. Yet you can master this anger and bend it to incite your allies to find new courage and strength. Those nearest you feel your wrath and make it their own, and the longer they fight alongside you, the more intense their outbursts become.",
