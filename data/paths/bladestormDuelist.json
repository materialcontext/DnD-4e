    "text": "Blessed with keen reflexes and stunning speed, you never developed a taste for heavy armor and cumbersome weaponry. You felt it was far more effective to dispense with the weighty gear so that you could stay fast on your feet, dance around your opponents, and deliver swift strikes every bit as nasty as a single blow from a greataxe. Other fighters might scoff at your thin rapier and your parrying dagger, but you wipe their smiles off their faces when you duck beneath their attacks and stick your blades in gaps between their armor.",
