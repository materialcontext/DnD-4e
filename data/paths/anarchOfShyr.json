    "text": "You have studied the ways of the anarchs of Shyr, an order of genasi swordmages who developed their arts thousands of years ago in Abeir. Students of this school harness the power of the Elemental Chaos to unleash devastation against their enemies.<br/> For centuries the anarchs defended the genasi realm against the draconic empires. They also served to check the power of Shyran lords when the rulers of that land veered toward tyranny. The order fell apart when the anarchs lost their way and turned to meddling and kingmaking. A handful of masters who remained true to the order’s ancient purpose preserved the anarch teachings. When Abeir and Toril merged briefly during the Spellplague, anarch disciples brought this ancient tradition to Faerûn.<br/> In the decades since, the way of the Shyran anarchs has spread slowly across Faerûn. Schools devoted to this path can be found in Akanûl, Aglarond, Calimshan, and the Dragon Coast. The anarchs of Shyr are no longer a unified society, and no longer serve Shyr—but a few still honor the old ways.",
