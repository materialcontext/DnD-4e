    "text": "As a luckbender, your manipulation of chance is a way of life. You’re accustomed to turning failure into success and cheating your way through dangerous situations. As your connection to the Elemental Chaos grows stronger, you can influence chaos in the actions of others, as well as place wagers on your own fate by using attacks and abilities that open up the full potential of chance to intervene on your behalf. With this path, you might make deliberate wagers on the whims of chaos, or swagger with the assured confidence of a master gambler. Either way, luck is on your side.",
