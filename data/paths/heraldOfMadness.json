    "text": "You are intimately familiar with the power that comes with controlling your enemy’s emotions. Fear is a good start, but you go even further, pushing fear into madness. You have chosen to draw upon the power of the aberrant creature that brings madness by its mere presence: the gibbering mouther. Your warcry carries the sound of a thousand voices, all shouting different things. Those who hear you claw at their ears, your voice infecting their thoughts and filling their hearts with terror.<br/> With this power comes a change. Your mind… is different, somehow. Some thoughts come only with difficulty, but at times, you know things that your friends and allies believe you had no way of knowing. You may sometimes try to share your unique viewpoint with others, but even your most innocuous comment brings pain.",
