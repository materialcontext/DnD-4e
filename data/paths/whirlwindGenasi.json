    "text": "The wind is immortal. Air moves and flows around us all, it is a source of life, and yet it is capable of wreaking terrible destruction. Hurricanes and windstorms can bring a castle down around a kingâ€™s ears, or hurl even the greatest hero off a cliff to rocky death below. Your race is connected to the currents of air as you are to all the elements, but for you air is not just a part of your soul; it is a source of incredible power. You are a whirlwind genasi, and your supremacy over wind is the stuff of legend.<br/> Flight, the ability to send your foes sprawling with gale-force wind, or the power to sweep the field of battle with a boulder-crushing, tree-splintering tornado are all as commonplace to you as a casual wave of your hand. You control the flow of a fight, using your power over air to move your foes like pawns around a chessboard.",
