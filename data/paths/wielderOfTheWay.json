    "text": "The desperate conditions on Athas call for desperate measures. Wielders of the Way use slivers cut from their own minds to strengthen their armaments.The exchange is worth its price, since it lets them disorient and destroy their foes. They can always reclaim the mental fragments, though some wielders of the Way consider certain emotions to be liabilities and believe life runs smoother without those feelings cluttering their minds.<br/> You entrust the wild, untamed parts of yourself to your weapon, mentally fracturing your personality and reinforcing your weapon—whether it’s an obsidian sword, a bone axe, or a rock warhammer—with that emotion. Though you still have a faint connection to that piece of your mind (at least enough to replace it later), you do have difficulty expressing the emotion associated with that fragment. Your allies find you inscrutable, wondering how you can fight with such ferocity while keeping a placid demeanor, or why your expressions and speech seem calm while you’re pursuing stronger and stronger foes.",
