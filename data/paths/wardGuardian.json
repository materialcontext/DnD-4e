    "text": "In your earliest arcane training, you learned to sheathe yourself in a layer of magical protection. This protection is your Swordmage Warding, and it represents an extension of your arcane mastery. Unlike other swordmages, though, you have taken this talent to the next level.<br/>You have long studied the secrets of the Swordmage Warding, and you have learned that the magical field is more flexible than most swordmages assume it to be. You have discovered that you can shape and sculpt your warding. Through careful study, you have learned to transform the warding into a protective barrier for your allies and into a dangerous weapon to distract or strike foes.",
