    "text": "A covert clan of enigmatic monks engage in assassination, espionage, and sabotage. They are mercenaries, taking commissions from the powerful or the vengeful. Members of the Unseen Hand are bound to the order for life—the clan’s mysteries are too sensitive to allow any member to withdraw or resign.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secrecy and subtlety lie at the heart of your training. As long as your enemies cannot identify your purpose, you have them at a disadvantage. You might achieve this subterfuge through cunning disguises, skulking through shadows, or misdirection. Mastering the higher mysteries helps you manipulate darkness, leap across vast distances, and penetrate your enemies’ minds.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a trained killer is not so different from being any other kind of warrior, but you must ensure that your tactics and techniques do not alarm your companions. At the same time, you must maintain friendly relations with the Unseen Hand clan or face ostracism, retribution—or worse.",
