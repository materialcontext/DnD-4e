    "text": "Nobility to the eladrin people is more than statusâ€”it is an investiture of power granted by the archfey in exchange for binding oaths and devotion. The eladrin refer to their nobles by many titles, and one traveling in their circles is bound to encounter coure, novier, firre, and others. Each title reflects a particular pact and the magical power gained as a result. The bralani are eladrin nobles who bind themselves to those archfey associated with nature, the seasons, and storms. The power they wield allows them to harness elements and make them their own.",
