    "text": "You thrive in the time between sundown and night. The shadows of twilight are all that keep you alive. They are a shroud even the Shadovar cannot pierce, from which you strike at their foul hearts. And long before the Netherese can find you, you’ve returned to the twilight shroud.<br/> You are a silent blade in the mists, a trained killer whose skill at stealth foils even those foes who live in shadow and illusion. You are a ghost of eventide, a vengeful spirit fighting against an ancient foe whose tyranny has long laid a crushing yoke upon your race. It is only through wit, skill, and perseverance that anyone could survive against such dread foes. You repay their evil with death, and your training makes you the very best and bravest of any knife-wielding rogue or shadow warrior. You live on the knife’s edge, tempting fate and inviting the wrath of some of the most powerful and vile enemies in all of Toril.",
