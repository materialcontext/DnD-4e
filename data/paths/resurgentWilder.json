    "text": "Practitioners of the Way form connections between their minds and bodies that allow them to go beyond their physical limits. Wilders with strong inborn talents have the strongest connection, and hurting such an individual causes his or her psionic power to flare even brighter. Some wilders have returned after being exiled to the desert, walking tall when they should be nothing but piles of picked-clean bones. Others have become notorious for their battle prowess, taking on wave after wave of enemies and dispatching each more viciously than the last.<br/> As your foes attack, your mind surges and you feel your muscles and senses burn with new strength. With every cut and bruise you suffer, more power rushes over you, making your mind more dangerous and protecting or healing your damaged body.",
