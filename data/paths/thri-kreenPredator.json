    "text": "Some thri-kreen fully hone their natural physiology, turning their bodies into weapons deadlier than the gythka. They strengthen their extra arms for making claw attacks, practice graceful jumps with their powerful legs, and augment their natural venom so it is potent enough to take down tough prey. Because of their battle prowess, these kreen often become the strongest members of their packs. It is the thri-kreen way to challenge weaker leaders, and the greatest hunters rise to positions of leadership.",
