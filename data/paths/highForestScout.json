    "text": "In the High Forest, the secrets of the deep, old woods are closely guarded, and few know of the many wild things  that walk amid the shadowed boles. Silver stags, wise hares, unicorns, butterflies the size of hawks, and tree owls that have survived a hundred winters roam through the gloom. Living, bark-wrapped pillars hold aloft layers upon layers of a mounting canopy that filters sunlight into a hundred hues of emerald and gold. But the High Forest shelters deadly danger, too. Wild forest creatures, tattooed savages, and haunted barrows are common threats that travelers face.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But worse lies farther in. Hideously disfigured and powerful plaguechanged creatures lurk in shadowed vales, forgotten demon servitors of Netheril wake to their mastersâ€™ return, and yuan-ti from Najara search for something they will not name. Many threats trouble the shadowed thickets of your home.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These enemies do not pass unmarked. You are the ghost in the trees, the arrow on the wind, and to monstrous creatures who haunt the woods, you are swift and merciless death. The forest is your country, and you do not take kindly to uninvited guests. Neither serpentfolk nor demon can hide from your arrows.",
