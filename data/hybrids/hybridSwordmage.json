  "classText": "You are no stranger to discipline and training, but you don’t have the single-minded commitment to arcane swordplay that a swordmage has. Perhaps in your youth you dabbled in the fundamentals of spell and blade but never dedicated yourself to these studies wholeheartedly. Some hybrid swordmages are new students of ancient magical traditions, coming most often from other arcane or martial traditions.  As a hybrid swordmage, you provide a good mix of melee prowess, battlefield control, and utility, but you can’t hold back waves of enemies quite as well as a full-fledged swordmage can.",
  "classFeatures": {
    "swordbond": "By spending 1 hour of meditation with a chosen light or heavy blade, you forge a special bond with the weapon. As a standard action, you can call your bonded weapon to your hand from up to 10 squares away.",
    "swordmageAegis(hybrid)": "This class feature functions as the swordmage class feature, except that you can use the power that you choose only once per encounter. However, you regain the use of that power when its target drops to 0 hit points or when its mark is superseded by another mark.",
    "hybridTalentOptions": "If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.",
    "swordmageWarding": "While you are conscious and wielding either a light blade or a heavy blade, you maintain a field of magical force around you. This field provides a +1 bonus to AC, or a +3 bonus if you are wielding a blade in one hand and have your other hand free (not carrying a shield, an off-hand weapon, a two-handed weapon, or anything else)."
