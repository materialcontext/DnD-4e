    "text": "It is one thing to excel at personal battlefield prowess. It is another to extend that skill to a group of allies, a phalanx of warriors, an entire army, or even an entire nation. You were always talented with a blade, but you learned early on that a dozen blades raised as one could defeat the mightiest lone warrior. Combining many individual efforts into one force is a daunting challenge, one surpassed only by the hazards of battle itself.<br/><br/>As a War Master, you seek to forge order from the chaos of battle. Under your command, your allies fight with unmatched coordination and skill. Your tactical skill and insight make you a daunting foe. Under your command, even a mob of ill-armed peasants is a daunting fighting force.<br/><br/>With each victory, you set your sights ever higher. As you grow in power, you seek to prove that no horde or army the cosmos can muster can best you and your forces on the field of battle.<br/><br/>Immortality<br/>You pursue not an escape from death’s bonds, but the very conquest of death itself, for death is the only force that can stand against you and bring your armies to ruin. With death conquered, you will live forever in glory, hailed as a savior—or perhaps cursed by those no longer allowed death’s release from a life of suffering.<br/><br/>Conqueror of Death: At some point in your career, only one foe remains to you, and you set out to conquer what no one has ever been able to defeat. Perhaps you marshal an army and lay siege to the Raven Queen’s palace, or perhaps doing that would only install you as a new god of death. Instead, you might take only your trusted adventuring companions on a final quest to slay death itself. Your final conquest might be hopeless, but you stand forever as a shining example to those who rage against the bonds of mortality.",
