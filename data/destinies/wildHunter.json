    "flavorText": "Like the firbolgs, you are a master of the Wild Hunt, dispensing justice for those who cannot do so themselves. You call on the creatures of the hunt to help you seek your prey, so that it cannot hide from that justice.",
    "text": "Deep in the Feywild, far from the stately halls of the eladrin, a tradition has been upheld for eons. In shadowy forests thick with moss and undergrowth, the baying of hunting hounds sounds, followed by the long strides of their masters. As storm clouds cover the sky, the forest is no longer a realm of bedtime stories or folk tales. It becomes the province of the Wild Hunt.<br/>The tradition of the Wild Hunt originated among the firbolgs, fey giants devoted to the moon and the Three Fates, personified by Sehanine (the Maiden), Melora (the Mother), and the Raven Queen (the Crone). The firbolgs call for a Wild Hunt when they seek to punish an oath breaker, for oaths are powerful things in the Feywild. Some mortals, their trust betrayed by the Unseelie fey, have learned to summon these eldritch hunters to bring down those who wronged them. A select few learn the ritual for summoning the hunters, but instead of asking for justice, request to learn the secrets of the Wild Hunt. Such requests are rarely accepted, but a worthy few learn the ways of the Wild Hunt, bringing retribution to all traitors and oath breakers.<br/><br/>Living the Destiny<br/><br/>As a Wild Hunter, you live for the chase. Your quests revolve around tracking down and dispatching oath breakers, either on behalf of those wronged by their failure, or simply to reestablish balance to the cosmos. As you bring down foe after foe, your prowess increases to the point that you turn your attention to the most infamous fey oath breakerâ€”the evil goddess Lolth.<br/>At first, you might have to settle for taking down her favored abyssal drow or her exarch. But the day nears when the clarions will call for the greatest of all Wild Hunts, and the Demon Queen of Spiders will feel that primal fear shared by all prey of the hunt.",
