    "flavorText": "You are the perfected mortal servant of a god, a shining example of all your deity holds dear.",
    "text": "In recognition of your faith, holiness, courage, and piety, you are elevated to sainthood. From the day you embark on this path, you can claim the title of Saint. Through dreams, omens, or angelic visitations, your deity makes your sainthood known to followers around the world. Those who share your faith hold you in the highest regard, while the enemies of your god naturally view you as the most terrible of foes. You might be a great crusader, a mighty prophet, or a revered sage. You set a sterling example of your deity’s values and guidance.<br/><br/>Immortality<br/>In the mortal world, you have only the years allotted by nature and fate. You could live to great old age, or you might die young as a hero or a martyr. When at last death draws near, you meet your end with joy—for now you go to the presence of the deity you have served so long and well. Your mortal body remains uncorrupted, and seems to be merely asleep; even the most gruesome wounds slowly vanish, leaving your body an imperishable symbol of divine grace.<br/><br/>Your immortality lies beyond this world, where you will stand among the highest of the elevated souls granted life after life in the divine dominions. In the dominion of your deity, you have a new, immortal body. You join his or her celestial court as a wise and valued counselor. Throughout the world you are regarded as an example of devotion and honor. When people face challenges and hardships similar to those you faced in your mortal life, they are heartened by your example.",
