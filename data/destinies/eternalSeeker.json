    "flavorText": "You continue to search for your ultimate destiny, but that doesn’t stop you from participating (some say interfering) in world-shaking events.",
    "text": "You might be a hero whose destiny is still unfolding. Maybe you’re a free spirit who wants to experience everything the universe has to offer before tying yourself to a particular piece of the cosmos. You might be a rebel who hates the concept of having a singular destiny and therefore claims that you’re not even interested in having a destiny. Or you may just want to avoid taking a side. Whatever the case, you’re carving such a wide swath through events that your destiny will have no problem finding you when the time is right.<br/><br/>Seeking Immortality?<br/>No one can predict your final destination. Compared to many other epic characters, your destiny has the advantage of being entirely mutable, so you might end up forging your own destiny by helping your friends accomplish theirs.",
