    "flavorText": "Nomads and exiles, slaves and free folk—all of them rally to your banner to sweep away the corruption of civilization.",
    "text": "You reject civilization and the temptations of the cities. You see the city-states groan beneath the sorcerer-kings’ tyrannies, and you observe how the people fear to speak out. The city dwellers, even non-slaves, give up freedom and morality for the promise of wealth and protection, but you do not make that choice. You have turned to the wilds to be your haven, abandoning “civilized” folk to the fate they deserve. You hone your body and master your techniques until the day comes when you will be powerful enough to tear down the city walls and bring an end to the sorcerer-kings’ villainy.<br/>As you embark on this destiny, your actions win you renown throughout the land. Wherever you go, people come to glimpse you. Throughout Athas, people whisper about your power and your intentions. Cities and merchant houses send envoys, bringing you tribute and seeking your favor. Raiders, refugees, escaped slaves, and fugitives flock to you. Some come to learn from you, and others come to fight on your behalf. Between your adventures, a mighty entourage surrounds you. Yet despite your acclaim, you are quick to strike out on your own or with a few trusted companions when adventure calls. Only cowards would have others fight on their behalf.<br/><br/>Immortality<br/>The desert tribes of your race—human, halfling, elf, thri-kreen, goliath, whatever your kind—flock to your banner. With them come exiles, brigands, mercenaries, and adventurers, all of whom sense the winds of change blowing across the deserts. A mighty storm gathers around you, a storm of war and blood that will cleanse the world of corruption. Whether you lead your horde away from the Tyr Region to found a realm elsewhere, or whether you challenge the cities of the sorcerer-kings, your decisions will forever change Athas.<br/>Shaker of Thrones: Upon completing your final quest, you unleash the long-awaited war. Cities burn, and your warriors conquer. Whether you are a blood-soaked warrior or an inspiring liberator, your horde reshapes history. When death arrives at last, your legend survives you; for a thousand years, your name will represent ferocity and military prowess.",
