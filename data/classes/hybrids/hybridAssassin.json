What drove you to seek out the Shadowfell’s power? Were you driven by grief, guilt, hatred, or vengeance? Something else? Is your divided focus the result of an incomplete bond? Or do you dabble in other areas to better conceal your sinister nature?  As a hybrid assassin, you can call forth shrouds to help guide your attacks where they can deal the most damage, but you sacrifice many of the techniques assassins use to evade their enemies.",
