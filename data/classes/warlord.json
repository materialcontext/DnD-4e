  "classText": "When dark forces muster in the wilderness, when hosts of monsters assemble to sack civilization’s last redoubts, it falls to the marshal to lead the warriors in defense of their lands. Marshals draw from their experience and passion  to lend courage, skill, and hope to those under their command. A warlord forms the iron core of any unit of soldiers, uniting their purpose and bolstering their commitment to see the conflict to its conclusion. A marshal’s talents can come from many different aspects of personality or endeavor. Some depend on  their bravado, goading their companions to take risks in order to reap great rewards. Others have keen insight into their enemies’ minds. Some marshals specialize in hit-and-run tactics, and others are resourceful leaders who always have some trick up their sleeves. The most common marshals include those whose presence alone is  enough to bind disparate heroes together and the tactical savants who spot weaknesses and exploit them. Marshals develop specialized combat maneuvers called exploits. In their elementary form, they are strikes and commands designed to shift the battle toward a more favorable outcome. In addition to these exploits, marshals issue commands and orders that improve their allies’ performance. Some of these commands can restore health and vigor, while others make allies more alert and ready for new challenges. Most marshals have already had experience in the field, even if it came from leading a tiny expedition. Some are former military leaders who have relinquished their commands to seek their fortunes in the world. Others might have lost their units and be out for revenge against the enemy that brought them to ruin. Whatever the individual’s triumphs or defeats were before becoming an adventurer, every marshal has the ability to lead, and lead well.",
