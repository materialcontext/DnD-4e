  "classText": "Psions are the quintessential manipulators of psionic power. Psions unleash the potential locked within every conscious mind, move objects with just a thought, and assume command of even the least desire of their foes. Psions make manifest their secret wishes when others can only dream.  You know the mental pathways that lead to amazing edifices of altered reality. You could be a brash human youth flush with your mental ability’s first flowering, a tattooed cenobite enrolled in a secret psionic academy, a fey enchanter using ancient techniques to beguile your foes, or perhaps a specially trained inquisitor who has learned one secret too many.  A flare of mental energy warms you, the thoughts of friends and foes glitter like stars all about you, and your thoughts themselves are weapons half sheathed. If a god can reshape the world and you can enthrall a god, what does that make you?",

    "psionicAugmentation": "Through discipline and careful study, you have mastered a form of psionic magic that offers greater versatility than other characters command. You know a broad array of at-will powers, each of which is a conduit through which you can pour as much or as little psionic energy as you choose. You channel psionic energy into a reservoir of personal power—represented in the game as power points—that you can use to augment your at-will attack powers, replacing the encounter attack powers that other characters use.   Because of this class feature, you acquire and use powers in a slightly different manner from how most other classes do.   At-Will Attack Powers: At 1st level, you choose two at-will attack powers and one daily attack power from your class, but you don’t start with any encounter attack powers from your class. You can instead augment your class at-will attack powers using power points. These powers have the augmentable keyword.   You gain new at-will attack powers from this class, instead of new encounter attack powers, as you increase in level. At 3rd level, you choose a new at-will attack power from this class. At 7th, 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 27th level, you can replace one of your at-will attack powers with another one of your level or lower. Both powers must be augmentable and from this class.   Power Points: You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd and 7th level, 1 additional power point at 13th level, and 2 additional power points at 17th, 21st, 23rd, and 27th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power.   You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest.",
    "ritualCasting": "You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals.",
    "rituals": "You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals (see Chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook). You own a ritual book, and it contains a 1st-level ritual of your choice. Choose either Sending or Tenser's Floating Disk. Your book also contains that ritual, which you can use without expending components once per day.",
    "implements": "Psions employ orbs and staffs to focus their psionic energy into their powers. When you wield a magic orb or staff, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of psion powers and psion paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers."
