  "previewText": "The Forest Kingdom of Cormyr lies at the western end of the Sea of Fallen Stars, nestled between the Storm Horns and the Thunder Peaks and stretching from the Stonelands to the Dragonmere. Dominated by humankind, Cormyr has been ruled by House Obarskyr for over fourteen centuries, with the strong backing of an army of heavily armored knights on Cormyrian destriers and magically potent war mages.",
  "benefit": "You add Insight to your class skill list, you gain a +2 bonus to Insight checks, and you gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against fear effects.",
  "flavor": "The Forest Kingdom emerged from the Spellplague largely unscathed but threatened from the north by the resurrected Empire of Netheril, whose agents (called the Shadovar) are suspected to lurk in every shadow, and from the east by their Sembian clients. In the past century, House Obarskyr has reclaimed its strong authority and reluctantly become an imperial power, conquering cities to the east and west. The populace has gained new freedoms and forms the backbone of the regionâ€™s strength. Armed adventurers are still required to carry a written charter, but such charters are now granted by any herald upon request.",
  "name": "Cormyr(general)"
