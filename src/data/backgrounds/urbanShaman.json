You barter with the spirits of stone and steel, speaking with the ancient foundations of the city and the dominant force that drives it. Is it a fortress driven by war? A market with a dozen spirits of commerce all clamoring for attention? Is the heart of the city the great academy? You know, because you hear its voice. You barter with the spirits for the good of your people, and you use these same skills to keep peace between packs. You learned the ways of the wild from your ancestors, but in the city you feel most at home.
