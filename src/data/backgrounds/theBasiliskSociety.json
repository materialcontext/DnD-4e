Basilisk swore to bring down tyranny and place rulership justly in the hands of the people. But their secret leader, an ash nymph known as the Golden Mistress, runs a criminal cartel to bring about the downfall of civilization so that it can be reclaimed by nature. She will not let you escape because she gave you her blessingâ€”her true kiss of trust. You know too much, and now you must be reclaimed or silenced. In cities, she hunts you with assassins and thugs; in nature, she hounds you with wild beasts and fey.",
