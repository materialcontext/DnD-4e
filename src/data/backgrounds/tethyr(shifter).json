  "flavor": "The noble Janors of Zazesspur hide a terrible secret—many of them can shed their skins. The family has several wereserpent members, and keeps this shameful knowledge hidden. None suspect that the sly, lithe, and beautiful Janor house smiles with poison-tipped fangs. Shifters that result from their unions with humans and half-elves are therefore carefully hidden. Without such precautions, many would move to destroy the Janors, first and foremost the noble family’s scaled and sibilant masters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do the qualities of your wereserpent heritage show themselves in your shifter anatomy? How were you hidden from public view? Perhaps you were trained as an assassin for those who command your family members with seductive whispers. Maybe you were only allowed on the streets at night. Do you know who controls your family’s fate? Do you want to save your family from itself, or have you made enemies of too many of them?",
