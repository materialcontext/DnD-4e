  "flavor": "The Sea of Dust was once a verdant land, destroyed by unchecked magic in a storm of hatred and destruction. The power released in these cataclysmic rituals erased the ruling civilizations, reducing their cities to rubble and their fertile lands to areas of waste. Yet even in the wake of this devastation, life continues—testimony to nature’s resilience. The nomadic peoples of the Sea of Dust band together, seeking to heal the land ravaged by their ancestors.Having long roamed the Sea of Dust, you have become inured to its challenges. Dragonborn and tieflings are the most likely races to come from this homeland, but humans as well as firesoul and windsoul genasi are found here, too. Barbarians and shamans are the best class choices.",
