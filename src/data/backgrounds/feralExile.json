Your ancestors discovered the primal magic in the wildest places of the world, long ignored by the arcane magicians of the empire, and adopted a new lifestyle suited to the savage wilderness. More than many other primal characters, you might be drawn to the ferocity and bloodthirsty nature of some beast spirits, and you might be more at home in desolate, blasted wastelands than in verdant swamps or forests.
