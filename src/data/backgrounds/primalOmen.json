The omens were said to point to the primal spirits’ favor, and no one was surprised when you mastered the evocations of your class. However, just before her death, your mother tried to tell you that there was more to the omen—something more troubling, perhaps even sinister. She couldn’t get the words out, and no one else knew or was willing to tell you what the elders had said about your birth. You left your home partly to prove that you are the master of your own destiny, and you still don’t know what destiny Great Watcher foresaw for you.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Nature<br/><p class=\\\"publishedIn\\\">Published in <a href=\\\"http://anonym.to/?http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950232\\\" target=\\\"_new\\\">Primal Power</a>, page(s) 133.</p>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    </form>\\r\\n</body>\\r\\n</html>\\r\\n\\r\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\">\\r\\n    if (document.all) {\\r\\n        if (document.documentMode != 9) {\\r\\n            var ar = document.getElementsByTagName('span'\\r\\n            for (var i = 0; i < ar.length; i++ ) {\\r\\n                var c = ar[i].attributes['class'].value;\\r\\n                if (c == 'milevel')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-24px\\\";\\r\\n                else if (c == 'miright')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-18px\\\";\\r\\n            }\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }\\r\\n</script>\\r\\n');\n",
