You spent your youth working on a farm not far from the area where you were found. That lifemight have been enough for you, for youâ€™ve always felt a deep connection to the earth. However, when your new homeland was attacked by goblin raiders and its citizens were murdered, you felt a presence within your blood that called you to action, and you have been following that call ever since.Who took you in when you were found? Was that person a loving foster parent or a cruel taskmaster? What experiences in your youth nurtured your apparently inborn connection to the primal spirits, and how has that connection flourished in your adulthood?",
