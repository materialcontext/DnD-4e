  "flavor": "You are an idealistâ€”a person who believes that civilization and the rule of law, while not flawless, creates the best existence for all people. Maybe that rule of law comes under a strong central authority, such as a tyrant or dictator. Maybe it is more benign and inclusive. Whatever the case, civilization is a far better thing than the darkness and savagery that rules most of the world. And that sad state does not solve itself. It needs brave people to bring the light of civilization into the dark of wilderness, and to help the good people trapped in that savagery who want a better, more ordered and stable, life.",
