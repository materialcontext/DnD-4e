Kranos was a bold and unswerving hero who bowed to none. Indeed, Kranos gained infamy for his dread belt of crowns: a collection of the severed heads of leaders who sought to enslave or manipulate him.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your tribe stems from those Kranos fathered and those who sought to serve him while he lived. Yet Kranos kicked lapdogs away from him. If others followed him and his example, so be it, but Kranos would have no one lick his hooves clean. Thus, your clan accepts only those who can stand on their own and who have the will and strength to take what they want from life. You have leaders among your clan, but they earn their role by proving they are worth following. You might already be one of these leaders, or you might be seeking to prove your worth through adventure.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Intimidate<br/><p class=\\\"publishedIn\\\">Published in <a href=\\\"http://anonym.to/?http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/389\\\" target=\\\"_new\\\">Dragon Magazine 389</a>, page(s) 33.</p>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    </form>\\r\\n</body>\\r\\n</html>\\r\\n\\r\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\">\\r\\n    if (document.all) {\\r\\n        if (document.documentMode != 9) {\\r\\n            var ar = document.getElementsByTagName('span'\\r\\n            for (var i = 0; i < ar.length; i++ ) {\\r\\n                var c = ar[i].attributes['class'].value;\\r\\n                if (c == 'milevel')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-24px\\\";\\r\\n                else if (c == 'miright')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-18px\\\";\\r\\n            }\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }\\r\\n</script>\\r\\n');\n",
