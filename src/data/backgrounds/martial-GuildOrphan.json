You have a mastery over locks, traps, and mechanical devices that is possible only for one who has grown up with thieves’ tools as toys. Your upbringing has left you with a distorted view of society. Unless one member of the thieves’ guild took you under his or her wing, you probably suffered cruelty during your childhood. A thieves’ guild rarely lets its members walk away to pursue other careers. The guild expects a lifetime of service in return for training and care.
