Malar  was their patron god, and they remain devoted to him as the exarch of Silvanus. Many of the smaller tribes, particularly those populated by wereboars and werewolves, still take captives and make sacrifices to Malar in bloody rites. Others have come to take a broader view, and while Beastlord worship forms the basis of their lives, there are times when their existence is not devoted to savagery.
