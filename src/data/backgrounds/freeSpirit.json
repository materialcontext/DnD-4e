  "flavor": "The ultimate symbol of primal power, to your eyes, is the ever-changing, relentless rush of water. The spirits you evoke are nature spirits of lakes, rivers, and rain, or animal spirits of fish, waterfowl, and songbirds. Water is everywhere, a sign of freedom that encourages you to stay on the move. You might come from a halfling tribe that wanders a marsh, a river, or a coastline. Or you could come from a city, where artificial pools and aviaries are your only connection to the spirits you revere.",
