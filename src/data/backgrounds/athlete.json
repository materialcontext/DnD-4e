You might throw hammers, spears, or discs, or you could be a sprinter, a swimmer, a gymnast, or an equestrian. You have participated in athletic competitions, both in small settlements and in major cities. In your youth, you participated in athletic challenges for your own enjoyment or fitness, and you found you had a knack for them. Now, you are in top physical condition, and your athletic training has aided you in your martial prowess.
