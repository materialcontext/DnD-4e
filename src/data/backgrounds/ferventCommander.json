Like many dragonborn, you experience emotion deeply—you become furious, not annoyed, and bubble over with joyous laughter when others might smile to themselves. In battle, your ferocity and enthusiasm more than make up for a certain lack of discipline, and you’re more likely to rush into the fray than wait in a shield wall with your allies. Your passion rubs off on your allies, making you something of a leader figure even if that’s not your combat role in game terms. It’s hard not to follow where you lead, simply because you go there with such enthusiasm and commitment.<br/><br/>What stirs your passion for adventuring? Is it a lust for glory, a thirst for gold, or a crusading hatred of monstrous evil? Or is it simply the thrill of being out in the world, rootless and free, risking your life every day in<br/>bloody battle? <br/><br/>Are you a warlord who gets your allies worked into a frenzy to improve their fighting ability? A rogue whose fervor in battle leaves your enemies off guard? A fighter who leads by example, expecting that your passion itself is contagious? Or a ranger who gets lost in the whirl of blades until the battle itself fades from your conscious awareness?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Intimidate<br/><p class=\\\"publishedIn\\\">Published in <a href=\\\"http://anonym.to/?http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.php?x=dnd/products/dndacc/251200000\\\" target=\\\"_new\\\">Player's Handbook Races: Dragonborn</a>, page(s) 17.</p>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    </form>\\r\\n</body>\\r\\n</html>\\r\\n\\r\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\">\\r\\n    if (document.all) {\\r\\n        if (document.documentMode != 9) {\\r\\n            var ar = document.getElementsByTagName('span'\\r\\n            for (var i = 0; i < ar.length; i++ ) {\\r\\n                var c = ar[i].attributes['class'].value;\\r\\n                if (c == 'milevel')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-24px\\\";\\r\\n                else if (c == 'miright')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-18px\\\";\\r\\n            }\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }\\r\\n</script>\\r\\n');\n",
