  "flavor": "You never trained in a military academy or participated in a military company. You werenâ€™t an apprentice to a master thief or a squire to a noble knight. No famous hero took you under his or her wing. Everything you know, you learned on your own. You dueled your friends for practice, and you watched soldiers from afar, so when the goblin throngs swarmed your hamlet, you were ready. You rallied other young men and women behind you and rounded up weapons to mount a defense. You repelled the creatures, and your efforts attracted the attention of a local lord. The lord offered you the opportunity to receive proper martial training, and you accepted, beginning your life as a warrior.",
