You dueled your friends for practice, and you watched soldiers from afar, so when the goblin throngs swarmed your hamlet, you were ready. You rallied other young men and women behind you and rounded up weapons to mount a defense. You repelled the creatures, and your efforts attracted the attention of a local lord.
