Perhaps you were raised by preternaturally intelligent animals in the wild, under the tutelage of the primal spirits, or you might have been born in a very remote tribe. You’re accustomed to the natural order and to nature’s form of justice. You enjoy a deep connection to the primal spirits, and you might never have heard of the distant gods of the Astral Sea.
