  "flavor": "You come from a remote estuary village where the moods of the elemental spirits are a matter of life and death. You might have been apprenticed as a child to the village elder or spirit-talker, or perhaps the spirits chose you later in life because of a traumatic event. Do you treasure your gifts, or are you haunted by them? What led you to leave your native tribe or home village? Are you driven by powers beyond your control, or are you a humble healer?",
