  "flavor": "Dusk elves protect their communities from trespass thanks to the gloaming guardiansâ€™ efforts. Deadly sentinels, they guard the routes into their communities, and if they encounter intruders, they use their considerable talents to drive interlopers away. Failing that, the guardians pick such trespassers off one at a time until they realize their error and return from where they came. You were trained to be one such sentinel. Why did you leave this responsibility? Gloaming guardians are sometimes the only dusk elves who meet other peoples. Was an intruder responsible for your break? How do your dusk elf family and friends see your leaving?",
