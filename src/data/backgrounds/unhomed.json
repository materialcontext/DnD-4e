You might have been born there, never setting foot on dry land before becoming an adventurer, or you could have used the community as a safe harbor for a time. As Unhomed, you learned the essential trades necessary for survival, and from this training you learned to anticipate the weather, repair ships, become an excellent swimmer, and serve as a cunning negotiator. Why did you leave Foamgather? Were you left behind by accident when the fleet broke apart? Or were you exiled for some accused crime? Were you innocent? If so, why were you blamed?",
