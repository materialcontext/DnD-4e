To do otherwise is to invite his storms upon your ship. But you’ve never feared his storms. When the lightning slashes the sky and the waves toss the ship like a leaf on the wind, you like nothing better than to be at the prow, leaning out into the tempest like a living figurehead. Other sailors think you’re crazed. On a ship your bravery cannot be doubted, but when the storms come, your sanity has been questioned. You’ve been lashed to the mast, and some have accused you of attracting Kord’s wrath. You know the truth, though. On the sea you hear Kord the clearest, and in his storms you laugh along with him.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you captain of a ship or just a crew member? On what kinds of vessels did you sail: merchant, military, or any boat that left port? Why don’t you sail as often as you once did? Is there some danger in the sea you aren’t facing? Do you seek something on land such as a treasure or special magic item?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Nature<br/><p class=\\\"publishedIn\\\">Published in <a href=\\\"http://anonym.to/?http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/392\\\" target=\\\"_new\\\">Dragon Magazine 392</a>.</p>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    </form>\\r\\n</body>\\r\\n</html>\\r\\n\\r\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\">\\r\\n    if (document.all) {\\r\\n        if (document.documentMode != 9) {\\r\\n            var ar = document.getElementsByTagName('span'\\r\\n            for (var i = 0; i < ar.length; i++ ) {\\r\\n                var c = ar[i].attributes['class'].value;\\r\\n                if (c == 'milevel')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-24px\\\";\\r\\n                else if (c == 'miright')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-18px\\\";\\r\\n            }\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }\\r\\n</script>\\r\\n');\n",
