  "flavor": "Great toil often yields great rewards. You come from a clan of miners who laboriously scratch and claw buried treasures from the bones of the earth. Perhaps your clan’s mine is played out, and now you search for a new deposit to work, or maybe raiders destroyed your family’s holdings and scattered your group to the four winds. Do your kinfolk still wait for you somewhere? Are you drawn by the dream of founding a rich holding of your own someday?",
