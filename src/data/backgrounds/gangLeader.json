You clawed your way up through the ranks of the underworld until you led your own gang of thieves...at least for a time.<br/><br/>What set you on the path to becoming a gang leader, and what caused you to stop? Did something scare you straight? Did your gang commit crimes against the wicked and greedy, or were you less discriminating? Did your gang rely on simple burglary, or did you prefer more brutal tactics? What happened to your gang when you left? Do your former allies still respect you and can you rely on them for aid, or are you a pariah? Are you still wanted by some authority? Do your friends know about your past?<br/><br/>The cutthroat rogue or trickster rogue builds make good choices for this background, and the guildmaster thief is an obvious paragon path choice. As a warlord, you can use this background to explain how your character learned leadership skills.
