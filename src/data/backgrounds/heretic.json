You believe some legend in contradiction to common thought about your gods, or you practice rites in honor of your deity to which others object. What is it that you do or think that most people reject? Are you looking to make converts, or do you come from a heretical sect? Are you hunted by other faithful? Why did you take this difficult path when ordinary belief was open to you?",
