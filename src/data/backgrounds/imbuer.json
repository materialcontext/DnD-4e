  "previewText": "In two different ways, you could call me a collector. I gather antiquities—items who’ve borne silent witness to great events. And then I collect magic potence to imbue within those antiquities, improving them to the limit of my ability.",
  "benefit": "You can construct your own implements and wondrous items, given proper tools and raw materials. Making an implement takes two days, and making a wondrous item takes four days. Doing so confers no economic advantage, however. The item ultimately costs the same as it would if you’d purchased it directly. And you can cast Creation rituals as if you had the Ritual Caster feat.",
  "flavor": "The blending of magical power with mundane objects has been your forte, and you delight in the creation of new wondrous items and implements to channel your power. Who taught you how to make such items? Is there a particular item you’re keen to make, once you gather the rare and expensive materials for it? How do you assess the work of other arcane artisans when you encounter magic items in the treasure troves you find?Good Background: Wizard.",
