In your dreams, you have vivid glimpses of the Nine Hells and the torments they offer, as well as of the splendor of Asmodeusâ€™s palace and the luxurious lives of his most favored servants. What message do you take from these visions? What connection, if any, do you feel to the Nine Hells and their denizens?
