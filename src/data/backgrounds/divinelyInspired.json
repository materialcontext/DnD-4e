  "flavor": "Following your divine path seems as natural to you as breathing air. You never heard the call to religion because itâ€™s always been in you. Even as a child, you heard voices others could not and saw signs no one else seemed to understand. Did you hide your connection to the divine, or did others know about it? Were you an outcast because of your odd behavior, or did the community look to you because of your gifts?",
