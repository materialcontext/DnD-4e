  "flavor": "You peer into the cyclopean depths, watchful for the secrets the darkness can reveal. You use your mindâ€™s power to seize these visions, peel them apart, and arrive at their truth. You are a mystic and seer whose accuracy not even the priestesses can deny. When did you realize you had the gift for prophecy? Do you believe it is a gift from the gods or something with which you were born? Why did you leave your people? Did you reveal an unpopular omen and were you driven out? Or did you receive a vision that spelled out a greater purpose to which you are now committed?",
