  "flavor": "Many fey resent psionics users, feeling that they debase magic and encourage other races to usurp powers that rightfully belong to the folk of the Feywild. You, however, take the more benign view that you do not betray your fey heritage by embracing your psionic abilitiesâ€”you grow closer to it. By studying the psionic power source, do you hope to gain the wisdom and abilities that come naturally only to the archfey? And if you do so, will there be a price to pay for seeing the world as those powerful elders do?",
