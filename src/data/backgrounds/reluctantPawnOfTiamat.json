You might fear her, certainly, and even respect her power—but if it were up to you, you’d rather forsake the power she’s given you than actually carry out her will. Perhaps you trained as an avenger to hunt down Tiamat’s enemies, but some event awakened your long-dormant conscience and spurred you to flee her temple’s service.

Choose powers that emphasize the sinister nature of the deity who grants them to you, so that even your fellow adventurers are a bit scared of what you might do.
