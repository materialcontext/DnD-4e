You inherited a keen awareness of nature and an affinity for the primal spirits from your nonhuman parent, and a fondness for civilization and a reverence for the gods from your human parent. You see no conflict between these two worlds, and you move easily between the rites you use to invoke the spirits’ favor and the prayers you offer in the temples of the gods. You venerate your elf or orc ancestors and seek deeper understandings of your human side’s primal roots. Some people—perhaps even one of your parents— might pressure you to choose one path or the other, but for now, you choose to walk them both.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Nature, Religion<br/><p class=\\\"publishedIn\\\">Published in <a href=\\\"http://anonym.to/?http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950232\\\" target=\\\"_new\\\">Primal Power</a>, page(s) 135.</p>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    </form>\\r\\n</body>\\r\\n</html>\\r\\n\\r\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\">\\r\\n    if (document.all) {\\r\\n        if (document.documentMode != 9) {\\r\\n            var ar = document.getElementsByTagName('span'\\r\\n            for (var i = 0; i < ar.length; i++ ) {\\r\\n                var c = ar[i].attributes['class'].value;\\r\\n                if (c == 'milevel')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-24px\\\";\\r\\n                else if (c == 'miright')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-18px\\\";\\r\\n            }\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }\\r\\n</script>\\r\\n');\n",
