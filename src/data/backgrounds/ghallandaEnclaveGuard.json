Which enclave did you guard? What unusual or famous fugitives did you meet while guarding the enclave? Did you ever break up a conflict among those who sought Ghallanda’s hospitality, and does someone owe you thanks or bear a grudge as a result? Did you ever smuggle people out of your enclave—or kick them out because they were threatening others?",
