In fact, the members of your tribe can sometimes pass as human. But now, as the raiding from other orc tribes worsens and war seems more and more likely, you are in a quandary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you stay in service to Many-Arrows, working to maintain peace even as the treaty begins to crumble?Should you strike out on your own, acting as a translator, entertainer, or advisor to other nations as they navigate the complicated situation regarding Many-Arrows? Or have you given up on your orc cousins completely, and now just want to make your own way in the world, using your skill and wits for your own gain?",
