  "flavor": "Nerath is dead, and if you have anything to say about it, it’ll stay that way. As a citizen of a former rebellious province, your heritage is filled with tales of subjugation, and you hold nothing but resentment for humanity’s “greatest civilization.” How do these feelings manifest themselves? Do you actively seek out Nerathi sites or artifacts to vandalize? Or do you make it your mission to restore and celebrate the traditions of your homeland before it was conquered? Are you filled with bitterness over the past or optimism for the future, eager to step out of Nerath’s failed legacy?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Quests: Impair those who cling to worn-out ethics; restore elements of your homeland’s culture; find a way to extinguish the Flame Imperishable.",
