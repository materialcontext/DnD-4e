Will you fight to liberate the others held by the necromantic cabal?Possible Minor Quests: You might have escaped, but your former captors are not likely to let you stay free. You might have to avoid their attempts to reclaim you, so you are always moving and staying one step ahead of them. Or you might go back, intent on freeing your fellows and razing the necromancers’ city.",
