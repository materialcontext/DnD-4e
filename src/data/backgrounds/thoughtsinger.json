Instead of the sound of music, you share memories of joy and sorrow. If you are a thoughtsinger of hashalaq heritage, you might choose to specialize in diplomacy and deception, but if you are a tsucora thoughtsinger, you could prey on the doubts and fears of your foes. As you weave dreams, do you choose to do so with finesse and a light touch, or do you prefer to overwhelm your audience?",
