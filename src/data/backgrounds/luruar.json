  "flavor": "The past century saw several smaller forests merge into the Glimmerwood. Although the cities of Everlund, Silverymoon, and Sundabar remain strong and united, dwarven allies of old have withdrawn. The boundaries around Luruar have changed as well, with the formation of the orc nation of Many-Arrows to the north, the opening of the elven kingdom of Evereska to the south, and the expansion of Netheril to the east.",
