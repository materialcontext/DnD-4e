  "classText": "As wanderers, mercenaries, and adventurers, battleminds are carefree warriors who seek only to test their skill against the mightiest and most dangerous opponents. Battleminds possess a potent combination of psionic and physical skill, allowing them to use their magic to manipulate and deceive their foes even as their fighting skill lets them carve a swath through enemy ranks. Battleminds tend to be bold and sometimes arrogant, an attitude earned through bringing ruin to enemies over the course of many conflicts.  You might not share your fellow battleminds’ arrogance, but you do have access to an array of combat abilities that let you manipulate, baffle, and defeat your enemies. Your mind is as deadly as your weapon, and with the aid of your psionic magic, your body can turn aside attacks as effectively as a suit of plate armor can.  Let those who would stand against your might quiver in terror when you approach, for you are a battlemind, and supremacy in combat is your birthright.",

  "classFeatures": {
    "psionicAugmentation": "Through discipline and careful study, you have mastered a form of psionic magic that offers greater versatility than other characters command. You know a broad array of at-will powers, each of which is a conduit through which you can pour as much or as little psionic energy as you choose. You channel psionic energy into a reservoir of personal power—represented in the game as power points—that you can use to augment your at-will attack powers, replacing the encounter attack powers that other characters use. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of this class feature, you acquire and use powers in a slightly different manner from how most other classes do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At-Will Attack Powers: At 1st level, you choose two at-will attack powers and one daily attack power from your class, but you don’t start with any encounter attack powers from your class. You can instead augment your class at-will attack powers using power points. These powers have the augmentable keyword. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You gain new at-will attack powers from this class, instead of new encounter attack powers, as you increase in level. At 3rd level, you choose a new at-will attack power from this class. At 7th, 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 27th level, you can replace one of your at-will attack powers with another one of your level or lower. Both powers must be augmentable and from this class. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Power Points: You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd and 7th level, 1 additional power point at 13th level, and 2 additional power points at 17th, 21st, 23rd, and 27th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest.",
    "psionicDefense": "Three powers—battlemind’s demand, blurred step, and mind spike—help you maintain tactical superiority in combat. You can use these psionic powers to demand your enemies’ attention, follow them if they try to avoid you, and punish them if they attack your allies. This combination of mental compulsion and psionic enhancement of your own capabilities makes you a force to be reckoned with in battle.",
    "psionicStudy": "Battleminds learn to fight using their bodies as weapons. Some battleminds alter their own form to fit their needs. Other battleminds use their psionic power to predict the best position for launching an attack.",
    "battleResilience": "You gain the battle resilience power, which reflects your ability to use your psionic power to bend your own body to protect yourself.",
    "persistentHarrier": "You gain the persistent harrier power, which reflects the ease with which you can outmaneuver your opponents.",
    "speedOfThought": "You gain the speed of thought power, which allows you to be always ready for a fight.",
    "wildFocus": "You gain the wild focus power, which reflects the raw telekinetic power you wield in combat."
  },
  "characteristics": "Your heavy armor allows you to take on your enemies' attacks without fear, and your melee attacks that are augmented by psionic magic let you control your enemies like puppets and set them up for defeat. You excel at controlling the battle line and forcing enemies to fight you while your allies wreak havoc.",
  "religion": "Battleminds who live up to this class's renowned arrogance rarely pray to the gods, and stories abound of battleminds whose ill luck could be placed at the feet of their impiety. Those battleminds who do follow the gods typically revere Kord for his martial skill and strength, Bahamut for his practice of justice, or Ioun for being the originator of psionic magic.",
  "races": "Half-elves are ideal quick battleminds, channeling their natural Charisma into psionic alacrity. Goliaths' sheer physical power makes them well suited for this class, and many gnome and tiefling warriors are drawn to the guile and trickery of some battlemind powers."
