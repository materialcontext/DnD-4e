  "classText": "Artificers treat mastery of magic like a technical skill. They see patterns in energy and matter, and they understand how to manipulate the flow of magic in and around objects and creatures. Artificers channel energy into items using magical components, diagrams, and complex chains of sigils. Their skills let them assemble a magic device for any situation.   As an artificer, you might be a formal student of magic who became interested in artifacts and arcane items. Alternatively, you could be a tinkerer who devised magic tools in a musty basement. Or perhaps you are an explorer who found your knowledge in the forgotten places of the world. Whatever the source of your talents, a passion for the technical components of magic drives you to perfect your art.   With a bandolier slung across your chest, you carry an arsenal of alchemical compounds, magic implements, mundane materials, and tools. Your weapons, implements, and other gear are inscribed with runes and mystic patterns. You mix reagents, drink potions, and craft items. You use your knowledge to infuse yourself and your allies with arcane power. And one day, your magical skills will carry you into legend.",

    "overview": "Three artificer builds are presented here: the battlesmith, the tinkerer, and the warrior forge artificer. The tinkerer creates arcane constructs, the battlesmith infuses weapons and armor with magic, and the warrior forge artificer attacks from a distance with ranged weapons and implement attacks. All artificers rely on Intelligence to create and control their spells. In addition, Wisdom helps you animate constructs, while Constitution focuses your magic in nonanimate items.",

        "overview": "The warrior forge artificer fights from a distance, using implement and ranged weapon attacks to deliver punishment away from the front lines. The warrior forge artificer turns his allies into his weapons, while at the same time providing them with defensive bonuses so that they can stand up to the increased punishment that comes with having one less character in melee combat. Assign your highest ability score to Intelligence, and your second highest to Wisdom. The build offers a path of powers for implement users, as well as one for weapon users, but you can mix and match if you so choose.",

    "arcaneEmpowerment": "Your study of magic has given you the ability to manipulate the arcane energy contained within items. You begin each day with the ability to empower a magic item, and you gain one additional arcane empowerment for each milestone you reach. You must spend a short rest with an item in order to empower it. You can empower an item in two ways.",
    "augmentEnergy": "You infuse a weapon or an implement with a reservoir of energy that lasts until the end of your next extended rest or until it is expended. The wielder of the implement or the weapon can use a free action after making an attack roll to expend the reservoir of energy to gain a +2 bonus to that attack roll. An implement or a weapon can be augmented only once per day in this way.",
    "impartEnergy": "You recharge the daily power of a magic item. An item can be recharged only once per day in this way.",
    "arcaneRejuvenation": "Before combat, an artificer spends time infusing his or her allies’ magic items with curative energy. Whenever one of the artificer’s allies uses a magic item’s daily power, that ally absorbs the energy and gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier.",
    "healingInfusion": "You can create healing infusions for later use. At the end of an extended rest, you create two healing infusions that last until the end of your next extended rest. At 16th level, you instead create three healing infusions.",
    "ritualCasting": "You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals.",
    "implements": "Artificers make use of rods, staffs, and wands to help channel and direct their arcane powers. Without an implement, an artificer can still use artificer powers, including those that have the implement keyword. An artificer wielding a magic rod, staff, or wand can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of artificer powers, as well as artificer paragon path powers, that have the implement keyword."
  },
  "powersAndWeapons": "Some artificer powers have the weapon keyword and often require a ranged weapon. If the ranged weapon fires ammunition, the ammunition carries the power's effect. Otherwise, the weapon carries the effect. When the attack is made, a mundane weapon returns to the artificer like a magic thrown weapon does."
