  "classText": "A fair fight is not in the scoundrel’s vocabulary. Scoundrels find success on the battlefield by using every trick at their disposal to deceive, mislead, and ambush their enemies. They draw on their many skills to give them an edge in combat, whether that edge enables them to snatch a treasure from a villain or leap away at the last moment to thwart an attack. Scoundrels are survivors, and they are not above getting their hands dirty to win the day. A scoundrel relies on clever planning and quick wits to survive. A thief focuses more broadly on acrobatics and unpredictable maneuvers. Scoundrels trade the thief ’s reliable tricks for a broader, more unpredictable range of abilities. These martial powers, or exploits, mirror the scoundrel’s preferred tactics and arise from a mix of training, improvisation, and skill. Some scoundrels favor punishing exploits, focusing on hitting hard and inflicting terrible injuries. Others use witty banter and feints to frustrate and misdirect opponents. Others still favor acrobatics, menace, or secrecy. Scoundrels are adventurers first and foremost. One might have learned the trade on the streets, might have developed his or her powers out of necessity after fate betrayed them, or could have been apprenticed to a master thief. Some scoundrels join adventuring parties for the promise of treasure and have few reservations about exploring dusty tombs and labyrinthine dungeons as long as there’s a reward on the other side. Not all scoundrels are that mercenary, however. There are things other than loot that are worth fighting for.",
