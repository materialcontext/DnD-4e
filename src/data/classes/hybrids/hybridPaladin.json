  "classText": "You combine the divine authority of a paladin with the talents of another class to become a formidable protector. Many hybrid paladins have only recently pledged themselves to the path of the divine warrior after years spent in other pursuits. A few, however, have recognized that single-minded devotion isnâ€™t for them and have expanded their abilities accordingly.  As a hybrid paladin, you bring a useful marking ability and strong melee powers to a group. Like other de-fenders, you are durable and can protect allies well, but you give up some healing capability to gain the tal-ents of another class.",
