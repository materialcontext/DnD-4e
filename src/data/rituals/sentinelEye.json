You can use the View Location ritual to spy on the location where a triggered creature was when the eye was triggered, if you have that ritual, since you obviously know the area in which you performed Sentinel Eye. (However, that use has limited utility given the 1 hour performance time of View Location.)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ritual’s effects last for 24 hours.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by keeping a focus in the vicinity. This ritual focus is a small, jeweled eye made of gold and ruby, worth 2,000 gp. The Sentinel Eye lasts as long as the focus remains within 20 squares of any of the watchful eyes. You can hide or protect the ritual’s focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within range.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Arcana Check Result</th><th>Eyes Created</th><th>Vision or Ability</th></tr><tr><td>9 or lower</td><td>1</td><td>Normal</td></tr><tr><td>10–19</td><td>2</td><td>Normal</td></tr><tr><td>20–29</td><td>3</td><td>Darkvision</td></tr><tr><td>30–39</td><td>4</td><td>Darkvision</td></tr><tr><td>40 or higher</td><td>5</td><td>Darkvision, tremorsense 12</td></tr></table></p><p class=\\\"publishedIn\\\">Published in <a href=\\\"http://anonym.to/?http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217887200\\\" target=\\\"_new\\\">Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons</a>, page(s) 85.</p>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    </form>\\r\\n</body>\\r\\n</html>\\r\\n\\r\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\">\\r\\n    if (document.all) {\\r\\n        if (document.documentMode != 9) {\\r\\n            var ar = document.getElementsByTagName('span'\\r\\n            for (var i = 0; i < ar.length; i++ ) {\\r\\n                var c = ar[i].attributes['class'].value;\\r\\n                if (c == 'milevel')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-24px\\\";\\r\\n                else if (c == 'miright')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-18px\\\";\\r\\n            }\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }\\r\\n</script>\\r\\n');\n",
