    "text": "You call a nature spirit into your service to act as a guide. The guide takes the form of a Medium or smaller natural beast, with defenses equal to yours at the time you perform the ritual. The guide has 1 hit point, and a missed attack never damages it. It has a speed of 8, but it measures its pace so that you and your party can keep up with it.<br/>The guide leads you to a location you name as you perform the ritual. The destination must be a specific place, such as Shathrax’s Lair or the Tower of Kettenor. The guide cannot lead you to a general location, such as “a cave full of treasure,” or to an unknown place, such as “the secret lair of the dragon Arrythis.” For the ritual’s duration, the guide leads you to the destination by the shortest (although not necessarily the safest) route.<br/>Your Nature check determines how long the guide serves you. If you can’t reach the specified destination within the allotted time, the guide leads you as far as it can along the way and then vanishes.",
