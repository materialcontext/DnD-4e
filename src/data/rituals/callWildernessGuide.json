The guide takes the form of a Medium or smaller natural beast, with defenses equal to yours at the time you perform the ritual. The guide has 1 hit point, and a missed attack never damages it.

The destination must be a specific place, such as Shathrax’s Lair or the Tower of Kettenor. The guide cannot lead you to a general location, such as “a cave full of treasure,” or to an unknown place, such as “the secret lair of the dragon Arrythis.” For the ritual’s duration, the guide leads you to the destination by the shortest (although not necessarily the safest) route.<br/>Your Nature check determines how long the guide serves you.
