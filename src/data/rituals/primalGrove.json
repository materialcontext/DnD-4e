You use this ritual either to create a grove and an entrance to it or to create an entrance to a grove that you or someone else created.<br/><br/>Creating a Grove: When you create a grove, it appears in a hidden location in the world or the Feywild, and you determine its password. You also create an entrance to it (see “Creating an Entrance” below).<br/><br/>A grove generates enough food and drink to sustain its occupants and has a moderate, unchanging climate. If you move objects into a grove, they remain there when you leave, but food and other resources created by the grove disappear when removed.<br/><br/>Your Nature check determines the grove’s size in squares and how many creatures it can accommodate.",
