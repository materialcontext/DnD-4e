    "text": "You create a magical barrier that is up to 2 squares long and tall, and is typically large enough to block a doorway or the entrance of a hallway. The obstruction is invisible from more than 10 squares away but is readily apparent as a translucent, shimmering, paper-thin wall from closer than that.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When creating the barrier, you also determine circumstances that open the barrier; this is the same as for Arcane Lock (Playerâ€™s Handbook, page 301). Your Arcana check, with a +5 bonus, determines the DC for Knock or similar rituals to open it, and the DC to burst the barrier with a Strength check is 5 greater than that.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you spend 4 hours and four times the component costs to perform this ritual, the duration increases to permanent. A ritual caster who uses Knock or a similar ritual to open a permanent Arcane Barrier can choose to bring it down temporarily, in which case it seals again after 5 minutes, or to destroy the barrier.",
    "flavorText": "You pound on the translucent wall and shout, but no amount of  brute force seems able to penetrate the barrier in your path.",
