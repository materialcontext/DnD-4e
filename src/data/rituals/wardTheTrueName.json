You do not learn the nature of the ritual caster’s questions or efforts. You learn only the specific ritual that was performed. You also gain the ability to identify the ritual caster well enough to scry upon him or her in turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of this ritual ends when you have been alerted to a divination or scrying attempt.",
