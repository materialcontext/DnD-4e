    "text": "Choose a specific outdoor location that you have previously visited and that is within 1 mile of your current position. The location must be fixed in place, and it must be at the same place as when you last visited. You place a scrying sensor in a square up to 10 squares above that location. Gazing into your focus (a pool of water), you can see and hear from that square as if you occupied it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensor remains for 2 rounds. You can extend the duration by another 2 rounds by spending a healing surge.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scrying sensor appears as a shimmer in the air. Creatures can spot the sensor by succeeding on a Perception check (DC 10 + your level).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some warding rituals can block scrying sensors. If the location is so warded, or the location is otherwise unviable as a scrying target, then you learn this fact as soon as you start the ritual. You can then stop the ritual before you expend any components.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus: A 1-square or larger pool of clean water.",
