Furthermore, they can speak normally underwater.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Breathing doesn’t change your ability to breathe air. It doesn’t confer a greater swim speed or the ability to fight underwater unhindered. It does protect any gear you and the participants carry, such as books and scrolls, from water damage.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your check result determines the duration of the effect.",
