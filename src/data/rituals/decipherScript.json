You must examine the words for the entire time, after which you understand the gist of whatever the text says. You also make a History or Streetwise check, and if your result is 30 or higher, you can read the text as if you were fluent in the language. Each use of this martial practice allows you to examine about one page of writing or an equivalent amount of text.",
