It knows only what it knew in life and has no particular foreknowledge of events (though it might speculate).<br/><br/>If you choose, you can instead view one of the dragon’s memories as though it were happening to you. You can name aspects of the memory you want to view, and if you make no restrictions, the ritual shows you a memory pivotal to the dragon’s experience.<br/><br/>This ritual can be performed only once every 24 hours.",
