Up to eight creatures (including yourself if you choose) gain the ability to breathe underwater. In addition to this ability, targets can speak normally and gain a swim speed equal to their land speed. Subjects are unaffected by the cold and pressure of the deep ocean.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ritual does not negate the ability to breathe air or move on land. Equipment and possessions, such as books and scrolls, on a creature affected by the ritual remain undamaged by the water.",
