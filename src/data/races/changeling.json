As shape changers, changelings can appear to be members of any humanoid race, playing the part of a dwarf  one day and a dragonborn the next.

  "tipsTxt": "Lacking a culture or a civilization to call their own, changelings adopt other racesâ€™ societies. They seek out communities that have values and interests that parallel their own. Changelings prefer cities because they are ideal places to blend in with others or to vanish if necessary. Cities also contain people too interested in their own affairs to notice the oddities of strangers."
