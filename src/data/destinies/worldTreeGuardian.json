    "text": "You have seen the World Tree, the most ancient primal spirit of the forest. Legends say that the roots of the World Tree are the roots of the world itself and that any harm done to this ancient entity shakes the earth and cracks the sky. You chose to defend the World Tree, and in doing so, you were able to speak to it and gain its favor. You can now call on its power, granting you the strength and resilience of nature itself. The World Tree is intertwined with the world so that any harm to one hurts the other—an outcome you are sworn to prevent.<br/><br/>Immortality<br/>The World Tree has existed since the beginning of time. If you have your way, it will live longer still. <br/>The Tree’s Counterpart: You become the World Tree’s counterpart among the races of the world—a primal symbol of life and a worldly representative among the great spirits of nature. Accepted into the company of the most powerful and ancient primal spirits, you abandon your mortal form to become a being of pure primal essence.<br/>You are no longer as active as you once were in shaping the fate of the world; the actions that led to your immortality have kept the world safe for some time. Instead, you sleep soundly in verdant groves or walk the wider world invisible to the eyes of mortals. However, when the greatest dangers threaten the world, you heed the summons to convene with other great spirits to rally against those perils.",
