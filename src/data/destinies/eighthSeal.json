    "text": "You are one with the Keepers of the Cerulean Sign—perhaps through your exposure to their writings or other works, perhaps by serving their ancient cause through your deeds. In your ceaseless fight against the aberrant menace, you have focused on closing the breaches to the Far Realm where ancient safeguards have begun to fail. But your need to keep the world safe will exact a terrible price in the end.<br/><br/>Immortality<br/>Using your soul’s power and your psionic abilities, you sacrifice yourself to strengthen the boundaries between the mortal realm and the madness of the Far Realm.<br/>Living Seal: To complete your task, you must recover the ancient Cerulean Seals, believed to have been lost or destroyed since the keepers of old faded from this world. Your searching reveals that these are not devices, but rather the souls of the greatest champions who gave their lives to secure reality against the Far Realm’s corrupting influence. By working with these guardians, you merge your spiritual energy with their own and restore the wards they built.",
