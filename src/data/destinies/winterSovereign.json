    "text": "The greatest forces in the Feywild are the archfey, who are powerful and wise custodians of the bright echo, and sovereigns over the wild and free spirits dwelling in these lands. Each archfey governs an aspect of the Feywild, laying claim to the mountains, the forests, the Feydark, or even the seasons themselves. Your life’s work places you on the path to join this august society by ascending mortality and becoming an immortal guardian of world’s bright echo. Your future role could be anything, but your fate is to become master of snow and ice—the Ruler of Winter in the Feywild.<br/>The moment you realized the life you would one day lead, you have bent your efforts to understanding the Feywild and its denizens, while also working to master the elements you will have to wield. You might study under the current Winter King or Queen, or you might secretly work to usurp the role, leaching power from your rival for the fateful moment when you will supplant the monarch and stake your claim to the dark season. However you go about learning your role, your mastery over winter’s frigid power only grows.<br/><br/>Immortality<br/>Although winter dies and gives way to spring, one knows spring surrenders to summer, which itself must bow before autumn. In the end, winter always returns.<br/>Passage of the Seasons: The final test comes when you confront your nemesis. In defeating the foe, you earn your  right to become the next Ruler of Winter and your court awaits you in the Feywild. You abandon the mortal world soon after your victory, plunging into the Feywild just as autumn dies and winter’s chill comes on the northern winds. Instinctively, you know where your ice palace waits. You cross through the Feywild, as autumn’s servants bow to your newfound authority, and when you find the grand citadel, you accept winter’s coronet and begin your reign as winter’s ruler.<br/>As an archfey, you command those loyal to winter, governing and sheltering them from your enemies. Your strength waxes and wanes with the seasons’ passage, growing stronger as summer turns to autumn, and coming into your full potential when winter takes hold, only to wane as the days lengthen, ice recedes, and the snows melt. This cycle grants you immortality, erasing the effects of time each year when winter’s touch falls across the lands. And thus you rule for as long as you want until you are ready to pass the crown to your heir and leave all worlds for all time.",
