    "text": "When you follow this destiny, you begin to transform into an avatar of your dead deity, but at a price. As you leech power from your deity, your soul slowly dwindles and rekindles glimmers of the deity’s consciousness. You gain considerable power and mental resilience but sacrifice some of your life force to earn that power.<br/>As this connection grows stronger, you also become more attuned to the lingering echoes of your deity’s feelings and thoughts. You come as close to being one entity as is possible, and this brings the realization that you must surrender your individuality to ever bring your power to the next level and achieve the return of your deity—or, if you prefer, your transformation into a deity.<br/><br/>Immortality?<br/><br/>Upon completion of your final quest, you disappear, leaving only dust, as you are entirely absorbed by your deity. You become part of it, aware of what happens in the world around you, but unable to participate while your deity is still dead.<br/>Perhaps your sacrifice rejuvenates the dead deity, or it might increase the activity of the deity’s cult, giving it a chance at resurrection in the future. If your deity is brought back, you return as its avatar. As its most loyal servant, you might yet play a role in the future of the faith.",
