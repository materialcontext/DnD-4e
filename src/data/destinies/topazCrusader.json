Girding yourself in the protective energy contained in the psionic gemstone at your brow, you step out from this world, sounding one last battle cry as you carve a path of death and destruction into the heart of madness. You will end the Far Realm’s threat even at the cost of your own life.

You gain a +1 bonus to AC. You cannot be dazed or dominated. You gain a +2 bonus to Will against aberrant creatures, and you know the location of all aberrant creatures within 5 squares of you at all times. You don’t grant combat advantage to those creatures, and if they have cover or concealment when you attack them, you don’t take the -2 penalty to attack rolls against them.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you will it, this focus manifests as a topaz gemstone in the center of your brow.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Topaz Meditation (24th level)</b>: Your focus grants you increased power.
