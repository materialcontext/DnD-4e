    "flavorText": "You have focused the savagery of the Primal Beast through your nobility of spirit to become a monarch among the beasts of the wild.",
    "text": "You have channeled the ferocity of the Primal Beast through your limbs countless times, adopting a form that echoes the great spirit, the archetype of all beasts. Yet you are not a beast; you are more than just a reflection of the Primal Beastâ€™s manifold nature. By bringing its savage nature into balance with your humanoid spirit, you have become a synthesis that is more than either part. You are the Sovereign Beast, the quintessence of all that is noble and true in nature.<br/><br/>You are striking out on a path that none have previously walked to its conclusion, staking out a middle path between the way of beasts and the ways of the humanoid races. In you is incarnate the potential for the races to live in closer harmony with the world, in tune with their instincts but still awake to their finest qualities and highest ideals.<br/><br/>Immortality<br/>For now, you are an incarnation of a new ideal, the first of your kind. When your time in the world is fulfilled, though, you will become an elder spirit in your own right, a pattern that future druids will attempt to follow.<br/>A New Elder Spirit: Your work in the world complete, you transcend your physical form and become a primal spirit. No longer simply in the world, you are now of it, part of the circle of spirits that protects and preserves it. In your spirit form, you roam free, sometimes wearing the shape of a noble beast, sometimes appearing as a humanoid, but always holding the twin aspects of your nature in perfect and everlasting balance.",
