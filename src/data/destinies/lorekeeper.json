    "text": "You are a font of knowledge, a peerless scholar, and a custodian of legends, myths, and, above all, truth. Though you content yourself with study and reflection, people come to you from all over the world, and beyond it, for an audience. They seek to apply your keen intellect and wisdom to any number of problems: locating a long-lost artifact, solving an impossible riddle, or devising a strategy to overcome a horde of raging berserkers. Others seek you out just to talk, learn, and expand their own understanding.<br/>With such knowledge comes grave responsibility, for some truths are best kept secret. If you glibly reveal the location of a powerful weapon lost since the fall of an ancient civilization, you might very well doom the world to witnessing firsthand that weaponâ€™s power. If you withhold the cure to a plague, the deaths of its victims rest upon your shoulders. Ultimately, you must decide whether you hoard your knowledge or dispense it freely, and whether you have the wisdom to know what to reveal and what to hide.<br/><br/>Immortality<br/>Lorekeepers are among the most learned people in the world, and they rely on their vast knowledge to battle those who embrace ignorance and reject civilization.<br/>Grand Library: The ultimate expression of your temporal power is the construction of a grand library to hold your collection. By the time you complete your Destiny Quest, you have acquired more books, manuscripts, and other texts than you can catalog. The only way to prevent certain suspect writings from falling into the wrong hands is to construct a place to protect them. Whether you build your edifice in the mortal world, adrift in the Astral Sea, or hidden within the City of Brass, Sigil, or Gloomwrought, this grand library ensures your immortality. The library reminds all who behold its wonders of your singleminded commitment to preserving lore and your great deeds in pursuit of knowledge.",
