    "text": "You left home ages ago, saying goodbye to the comforts that a simpler life might have held. Following an unspoken yearning, you took to the road with other vagabonds. Your way led along sinister paths and to fateful deeds. In time, perhaps you and your companions came to be called heroes. Still, dark strands of fortune draw you onward to an unknown end.<br/>Until that end comes, you wander the world as a shadowy presence, turning up where you’re least expected or most needed.<br/><br/>Immortality?<br/>Providence saved you for the final struggle. When you reach that doom, who knows where it might carry you?<br/>Roaming Wyrd: Your wandering days are not at an end just because you’ve caught up to your predestined future. From a young age, you have been a cat’s-paw of fate, an unwitting agent of luck and ruin. You followed your calling where it led you and did what was required, and now you’ve finished what dark kismet has set before you. Those who know your story see you as fate personified.<br/>The tapestry of your exploits in life follows you, colored by your final act. If, ultimately, you brought good to the world, your legend is one of how fortune favors the bold. However, your story might have a darker hue from the inescapable pull of grim destiny.<br/>You wander the cosmos, held as a patron or intercessor by those seeking or avoiding fate. You could be the agent of a power related to luck or predestination, such as Avandra or the Raven Queen. More likely, though, you have cut the threads of the inevitable and transcended the snares of chance.<br/>Now, you drift free, straying wherever you wish for once in your life. In so doing, you serve as an example to those who wish to make their own way free of the ensnaring strands of fate and destiny.",
