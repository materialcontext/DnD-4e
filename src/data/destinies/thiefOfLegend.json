    "text": "Long ago, there lived a thief who was so skilled at the art of taking that nothing was outside his grasp. Some said that he could steal the throne out from underneath a king, make off with the princess’s smile, and snatch the stars from the night sky—all over the course of a single evening! How much of the thief ’s myth was true and how much has become the tall tales of legend is a matter of debate, but few take such stories seriously. Such tales border on the ridiculous for most people, but you know the truth: The legends are real, and you are that Thief of Legend reborn.<br/>The Thief of Legend could do all of the fantastic things that people today describe. This thief had fingers so light and nimble that some said he could steal the crown off the queen without her even noticing. His movements were so quiet that death could not track him. His plans were so cunning that he outwitted the gods at every turn. Artifacts guarded by thousands of angels vanished from Astral domains, and the only evidence that remained of the thief ’s passing were the faint echoes of laughter where treasures once were held.<br/>Yet these feats have, on occasion, been reproduced by other mortals. The true point of transition between master thief and Thief of Legend came when this thief learned how to steal things that are intangible. So great was this legendary thief ’s skill that reality bent to his trickery. He discovered ways to steal laughter, or memories, or the color from a painting. Now, generations later, that thief has been reborn, and you are coming to realize that you are the reincarnation of this famous thief. Over time, you have begun to recall the tricks and techniques that you mastered in that former life, and you are growing once more into the master thief that the stories still describe.<br/><br/>Immortality<br/>As you grow ever more enlightened about the thievery and trickery that you had mastered in your past life, reality once again begins to bend around you, allowing you to steal things that others say can never be taken.<br/>The Greatest Prize: Despite the fact that your skills can be used for greed and self-service, you have been spun back into the world for some purpose. You have one great thing that you must steal—one bit of thievery for which you were given a new life and incarnation. This prize is the subject of your Destiny Quest; you might be destined to steal the magic away from an ancient dracolich or to place your hands on the only artifact that can slay the dark goddess Lolth. Once you steal the object of your Destiny Quest, you have fulfilled your role in the world. Only then can you once again have the power to take what lies beyond the grasp of all mortals, as you finally recall the full extent of the techniques that allow you to filch the intangible.",
