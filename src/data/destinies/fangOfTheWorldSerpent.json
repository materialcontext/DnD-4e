    "text": "The role of the primal spirits is to protect and preserve the world. Even the World Serpent, whose coils could crush a god and whose fangs could pierce a primordial, exists to protect the natural order and balance of the world, not simply to destroy. Though the motions of the World Serpent’s mighty coils can shake the earth, he enfolds the world to shield it from harm, not to crush away its life.<br/><br/>You, though, are a living embodiment of the World Serpent’s anger. His venom courses through your veins, and your sinews carry the strength of his coils. You are meant to face some terrible foe—a demon prince or a primordial, perhaps, or even a destructive god who seeks the world’s demise. The World Serpent has invested you with his power for a single purpose: to destroy that threat and preserve the world’s balance.<br/><br/>Immortality<br/>You were born for this one purpose: to carry the World Serpent’s wrath to the enemies of the world. When that purpose is accomplished, what fate awaits you? <br/>Striking Serpent: The power of the World Serpent burns within you, and that power need not return to him when your mortal life has ended. When the greatest threat to the world’s existence is finally defeated and your Destiny Quest is complete, your spirit joins the world you fought so hard to protect. You become a new elder spirit—Striking Serpent—ready to invest a new champion with your power when another threat to the world arises.",
