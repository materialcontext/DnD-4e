    "flavorText": "The ancient dragon god, sundered into two deities at the dawn of time, lives again in you. The only question is whether Bahamut and Tiamat will let you claim his power.",
    "text": "When a god dies, its power does not vanish. It can be consumed, often by whatever being was mighty enough to slay it. When Asmodeus killed the god he once served, for example, he claimed that power and made himself divine. When the King of Terror killed Io, the god’s sundered body became Bahamut and Tiamat, and those newborn gods claimed Io’s power before Erek-Hus could steal it.<br/><br/>However, it is said that a fragment of Io’s power remained free, neither absorbed by the new deities nor consumed by the primordial. Perhaps controlled by a shard of Io’s mind, the divine power kept itself safely apart, preparing—it is said—for a time when the dragongod would return to life. Some say that one of his loyal angels harbored the fragment of his power, while others claim it was embedded in one of his mortal servants—a dragonborn. (See the Shard of Io background for more ideas.)<br/><br/>Somehow, this shard of divine power has come to rest in you. For now, you are little more than a demigod or an avatar, a distant echo of the dragon-god’s full power. The more power you acquire, however, the stronger Io grows. Through you, Io plans to return and reclaim his mantle as the god of all dragonkind.<br/><br/>Immortality<br/>You will live forever, there can be little doubt of that—or at least, the power of Io that lives in you will survive the death of your mortal form. If you properly fulfill your destiny, though, it will come to full flower in the rebirth of Io, either replacing Bahamut and Tiamat in the pantheon of gods, or making them his exarchs in a new celestial court.<br/><br/>Draconic Apotheosis: When you complete your final quest, you have either reunited enough of Io’s scattered power or amassed enough power of your own to restore Io to life. In a dazzling transformation, your body unfolds and expands, like a butterfly emerging from its cramped chrysalis. Enormous wings spread from your back, thick scales cover your hide, and your thundering roar shakes the earth. You have become Io—among the mightiest of gods.<br/><br/>Alternatively, your accumulation of divine power might not transform your own body into the god’s form. Instead, you might begin rebuilding Io’s ancient astral domain and then reforming his body. Your ultimate destiny, then, is not to become Io himself, but to become his favored exarch, serving at his right hand as a reward for your faithful service in returning him to life.",
