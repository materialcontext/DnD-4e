    "text": "You are the ultimate survivor. Kobold spears, goblin arrows, orc axes, dragon fire, the necrotic touch of a wraith—you’ve seen it all in your adventures. And you’re still alive to tell the tales.<br/>Death has tried to claim you many times, but it failed. You have either survived your wounds or returned from beyond mortality’s shroud. Each time you faced death, your soul quickened within your body, attaching itself more deeply to your physical shell.<br/>As you grow in epic power, destiny conspires to keep you breathing. You recover from wounds that would take the life of any lesser mortal. Your reserves appear limitless. Whenever an enemy tries to take you down, your retaliation seems assured.<br/><br/>Immortality?<br/>On the verge of your climactic confrontation, your body and soul become one. It seems you can’t die.<br/>To Live Forever: When you have reached your career’s destined end point, your immortality is assured. Simultaneously a being of soul and body, you pass through death’s final mystery only if you choose to do so. Until you decide to abandon your body, it is your vehicle to eternity.<br/>You could retire peacefully, perhaps taking up residence with your preferred deity. Fame and skill could serve you well as you live in a remote place in the world or among the planes, perhaps establishing a tradition to pass on your knowledge to younger would-be heroes. Alongside a Legendary General, you might fight the battle everlasting, or you could keep a vigil like that of the Eternal Defender. Perhaps you’ll wander without end, or take up a wild card position in the cosmos. One day, you might ascend to literal godhood.<br/>Your options are as limitless as your time now is. In the endless future, you might learn the method of your transfiguration into an undying being or some other form of wisdom the world needs. You choose whether to share this knowledge or to let it pass away if you finally give up everlasting life.",
