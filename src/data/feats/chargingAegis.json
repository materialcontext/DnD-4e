    "prerequisite": "21st level, swordmage, Swordmage Aegis class feature",
    "benefit": "When you use a charge attack and hit an enemy, you can use a free action (instead of a minor action) to mark that enemy with your Swordmage Aegis power, rather than ending your turn immediately. If you mark an enemy in this way, the penalty to attack rolls imposed by your mark is -3 instead of -2. After you use this free action, your turn ends."
