    "prerequisite": "Elf, any arcane class, Aerenal background",
    "benefit": "Choose one arcane utility power of every level you know. Each time you gain a new level of arcane utility powers, you learn one extra utility power of that level. In other words, you know two arcane utility powers of each level, one of which you can use on any given day. After an extended rest, you choose which arcane utility powers of each level you can use that day. This feat doesnâ€™t change the number of arcane utility powers you can use each day. If you have the Spellbook class feature, the extra arcane utility power you gain is in addition to the extra power gained through that feature."
