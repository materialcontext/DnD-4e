    "benefit": "When you use a wilden racial power, the first time you are subjected to forced movement before the start of your next turn, you can ignore the forced movement and shift 1 square as a free action instead. One creature adjacent to you before or after the shift takes cold damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. The cold damage equals 3 + your Wisdom modifier at 11th level, and 6 + your Wisdom modifier at 21st level."
