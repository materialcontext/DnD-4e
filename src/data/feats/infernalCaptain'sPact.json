    "benefit": "Once per encounter, as a minor action, you can place an Infernal Captain’s Curse on the enemy nearest to you that you can see. The curse wreathes the target in the semblance of hellfire. This effect radiates light like a torch (radius 5 squares) but creates no heat. When you hit a creature under your Infernal Captain’s Curse with an attack, the target grants an ally of your choice combat advantage on the ally’s next attack."
