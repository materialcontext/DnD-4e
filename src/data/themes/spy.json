    "text": "A secret war is waged in the city—a war of information. On the front line of this war, the spy excels. A city’s ruler might retain a network of spies to root out enemies. Ambitious nobles can recruit spies to find new avenues of power. Those who can’t maneuver this web of secrets are doomed to failure.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spies must work carefully amidst potential enemies. A spy can be anyone and no one, spiriting away vital information before disappearing to pursue the next secret. Drawing suspicion can lead to capture or death. Thus, spies who survive are highly skilled and adapt quickly to their environment. Some are trained in secret academies within the city while others are self-taught. Some hold great loyalty to their patrons while others are purely mercenary. And in the end, spies receive little glory; in fact, the best spies aren’t even noticed at all.<br/>",
