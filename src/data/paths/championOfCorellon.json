    "text": "A knight of the eladrin courts, you are pledged to the service of the lords of the fey. Along with valor and martial skill, you have shown exceptional patience, grace, and compassion—qualities admired in eladrin and elven realms alike. You follow a personal code that resembles the chivalric traditions of the mortal world, but you bring a fey perspective to the concepts of honor, valor, and fidelity. Most knights are obligated to prove their bravery by declining advantages that reduce risk in battle, but you do not scorn the bow, the spell, or the ruse of war when such tactics are effective. You have learned techniques for making the best use of agility and quickness even while wearing the heaviest armor.",
