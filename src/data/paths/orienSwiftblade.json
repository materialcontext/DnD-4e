    "text": "Among the best duelists of House Orien are the swiftblades, peerless swordmasters whose Marks of Passage enable them to cut paths between worlds with their flashing blades. As a swiftblade, you can slice a rift in the fabric of the world, dart through it, and then appear on the other side of the battle field. When you practice against your peers, the fights range across neighborhoods and cities as you and your opponent teleport from place to place.<br/>House Orien calls upon swiftblades to defend the house’s interests with weapon and word. The house dispatches the duelists to conduct negotiations or investigate disturbances in its travel network. With their sophisticated demeanor, swiftblades are often underestimated by House Orien’s enemies. Those who attract the ire of an Orien swiftblade quickly learn that the duelists are more than casual weaponmasters.",
