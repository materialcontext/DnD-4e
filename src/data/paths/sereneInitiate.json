You are not emotionless, but you believe that you should rule your emotions instead of being ruled by them. Anger, despair, fear—all turn the mortal heart away from the divine will. Likewise, you must remain vigilant against excesses of mirth, desire, or pride. You believe that powerful emotions and worldly attachments entangle the spirit with the mortal realm and keep you from paying attention to what is most important.",
