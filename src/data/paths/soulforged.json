Twin brothers Gildur and Toris Irontop fought fiercely and bravely, crying out to Moradin with each victory. They seemed unstoppable . . . until they came up against Durandus, “the Iron King.” Their axes could not nick his stony hide, and their hammers cracked against him. In the end, Gildur fled into the mountains with his grievously wounded brother on his back, praying to Moradin for guidance.",
