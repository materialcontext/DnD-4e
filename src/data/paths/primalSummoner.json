    "text": "Perhaps you were raised in the wilderness and learned to summon beasts to serve as your hunting companions. Perhaps your community needed protection, and you learned the ways of summoning animal guardians at a moment’s notice. Or it could be that you grew up hearing the whispers of animal spirits and are a master at calling them to your side. Whatever your route to the path of the primal summoner, you seek a mastery over summoned beasts that other druids do not possess. Some of your abilities help your beasts act on their instincts, whereas other abilities help you command those beasts with even greater skill.",
