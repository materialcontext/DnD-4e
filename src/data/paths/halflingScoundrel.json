    "text": "The greatest heroes of halfling legend are those who defeat giants, dragons, or other oversized threats to their homes and communities, using their wits, their agility, and a hefty dose of audacity. These heroes aren’t necessarily armored warriors wielding legendary swords, and they don’t have lands or noble titles. They are ordinary folk who rise to the challenge of the times, proving that size and strength aren’t needed to come out on top. You’re one of these heroes.<br/>Like most halflings, you have found that the best way to get by in a world full of much larger creatures is to stay out of their way. Doing that might mean keeping out of their sight or staying on their good side. It might also mean keeping out of their reach, or dodging their attacks. Stealth and trickery might not be weapons and armor by themselves, but they are a useful supplement to the finest steel. Coupled with your natural daring and determination, these strengths are enough to bring you victory against any foe, no matter how large.<br/>Compared to the legendary heroes of other races, you might come across as a scamp or a scoundrel. But the fact that you’re crafty, resourceful, and sometimes sneaky doesn’t make you any less of a hero. Avandra has blessed you with courage beyond question, ingenuity sufficient for any challenge, and the stealth you need to survive.",
