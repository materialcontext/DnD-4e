    "text": "The ancient curse forgeborn dwarves carry manifests itself in different ways. Although united in their uncommon appearance and the single-minded zeal with which they attack their enemies, a few dwarves, often the greatest heroes in their clans, manifest incredible power on the battlefield. When the fury is upon them, their bodies erupt in brilliant flames, obscuring their forms and scorching their enemies. Few forgeborn dwarves endure these transformations. Even the healthiest dwarves cannot withstand the fires burning within them for long, but a rare few learn to control the flames and to use them when most needed so they can destroy the foes they despise.",
