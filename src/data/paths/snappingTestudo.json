I might as well fight naked!&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter, proficiency with shields<br/><br/>Both legend and conventional wisdom suggest that dwarves first developed the style of fighting that exchanged a weapon for an extra shield. Being stalwart by nature, they appreciated a tactic that might favor those who stand fast. Being stubborn by nature, they vigorously pursued something counterintuitive until they made it work.<br/><br/>The other races only experimented with the testudo style as tales of the dwarf testudosâ€™ exploits began to spread. Today, members of all races can become testudos, but all still study the teachings of those first dwarf masters.<br/><br/>As a snapping testudo you exchange some of your damage potential for extreme defense and greater control of the battlefield. With your awe-inspiring shields and savvy, you force your enemies to fight where you want them to fight, and then cripple them whether or not they oblige.<br/><br/><h3>SNAPPING TESTUDO  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Two Shield Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action while using two shields, you gain a +4 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Two-Fold Defense (11th level)</b>: While you are wielding two shields, increase the shield bonus one grants by +1.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Behind the Shell (16th level)</b>: When you are in the way of a ranged attack against an ally, that ally has superior cover from your position instead of normal cover.<br/><p><h1 class=\\\"encounterpower\\\"><span class=\\\"level\\\">Snapping Testudo Attack 11</span>Steel Jaws</h1><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><i>With ferocious strength you slam your shields together, crushing opponents between them as though with enormous jaws.</i></p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\\\"images/bullet.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> 1</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding two shields.</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Target</b>: One or two creatures</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Attack</b>: Strength + 6 vs. Reflex<br/>Level 21: Strength + 9 vs. Reflex</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Hit</b>: 2d8 + Strength modifier damage, and the target is dazed until the end of your next turn.</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Effect</b>: If you hit two targets with this power, slide one 2 squares to a square adjacent to both the other target and to you.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class=\\\"dailypower\\\"><span class=\\\"level\\\">Snapping Testudo Utility 12</span>Shielded Aggression</h1><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><i>While safe within your shielded shell, you attack with greater power and strike your foes harder.</i></p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\\\"images/bullet.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Stance</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding two shields.</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Effect</b>: Until the stance ends, whenever you hit an enemy while using a shield, you can choose to slide the target 1 square or increase by 1 square any forced movement that the attack already grants.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class=\\\"dailypower\\\"><span class=\\\"level\\\">Snapping Testudo Attack 20</span>Paddlewheel</h1><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><i>You spin through the battlefield like a tornado, using your shields to buffet and reposition foes as you go.</i></p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\\\"images/bullet.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> 1</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding two shields.</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Effect</b>: You shift 2 squares.</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Primary Target</b>: One or two creatures</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Primary Attack</b>: Strength + 8 vs. Reflex</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Hit</b>: 2d10 + Strength modifier damage, and you slide the primary target 2 squares and knock the primary target prone.</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Miss</b>: Half damage, and you slide the primary target 1 square.</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Effect</b>: You shift up to 2 squares and make a secondary attack.</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Secondary Target</b>: One or two creatures that are not primary targets</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Secondary Attack</b>: Strength + 8 vs. Reflex</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hit</b>: 2d10 + Strength modifier damage, and you slide the secondary target 2 squares and knock the secondary target prone.</p><br/></p><p class=\\\"publishedIn\\\">Published in <a href=\\\"http://anonym.to/?http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/385\\\" target=\\\"_new\\\">Dragon Magazine 385</a>, page(s) 44.</p>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    </form>\\r\\n</body>\\r\\n</html>\\r\\n\\r\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\">\\r\\n    if (document.all) {\\r\\n        if (document.documentMode != 9) {\\r\\n            var ar = document.getElementsByTagName('span'\\r\\n            for (var i = 0; i < ar.length; i++ ) {\\r\\n                var c = ar[i].attributes['class'].value;\\r\\n                if (c == 'milevel')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-24px\\\";\\r\\n                else if (c == 'miright')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-18px\\\";\\r\\n            }\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }\\r\\n</script>\\r\\n');\n",
