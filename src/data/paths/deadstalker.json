    "text": "With the innate ability to sniff out the undead, you have dedicated your life to the stalking and slaying of such abominations. Perhaps the calling of this vocation was passed down from your parents as a macabre tradition. Maybe vengeance has motivated you to slay the unliving. Perhaps you’ve turned your birthright into an asset that allows you to protect those weaker than you. You have channeled your sharp perception into deadly accuracy and slippery maneuverability—both of which also serve you against the living.",
