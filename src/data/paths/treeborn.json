    "text": "You dream of leaves shining in the sun, giving you the strength of ten. You dream of roots burrowing into the earth, providing unyielding support. You dream of towering over your foes as tree looks down on undergrowth. Then you open your eyes and smile, because it is no dream.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have embraced your origins and have learned the trick of manifesting a strength few others can hope to match, either in raw power or in size. You reach for this strength as a guardian of living things everywhere, be they plants or animals, as well as humanoids who’ve learned to live in harmony with nature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who can’t learn coexistence, you have nothing but disdain. If their crimes are severe enough, you act swiftly, showing the enemies of life the error of their ways.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When combat beckons, your height begins to increase. Like a stem seeking the sun, your torso and limbs lengthen as the battle rages, and they reach farther and farther until you can manipulate your foes as if you were a much larger creature.",
