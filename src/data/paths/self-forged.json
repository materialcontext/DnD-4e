Most folks resent, distrust, or tolerate warforged. You take a different view: You want to become one.

The battlefist replaces your hand, requiring you to sever your own appendage to make way for the new addition. As a result, only the most dedicated or mad artificers embark on this path.<br/><br/><h3>SELF-FORGED  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Battlefist (11th level)</b>: You have a battlefist, which replaces your hand. The battlefist is a melee weapon with which you are proficient. It is a part of the mace weapon group, deals 1d8 damage, and has a +3 proficiency bonus. You can hold items in your battlefist as though it were your hand, but you must not be holding anything when you use your battlefist as a weapon. You can use the Enchant Magic Item, Disenchant Magic Item, and Transfer Enchantment rituals on the battlefist. Using Disenchant Magic Item on the battlefist does not destroy it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fortifying Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain temporary hit points equal to 5 + one-half your level.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Supporting Construction (11th level)</b>: The parts you graft onto your body make you more durable. You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against ongoing damage.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Added Resilience (16th level)</b>: Whenever you make a death saving throw, you can take the better of your die roll or 10.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>More Metal Than Flesh (16th level)</b>: You can attach and embed components as if you were a warforged.<br/><p><h1 class=\\\"encounterpower\\\"><span class=\\\"level\\\">Self-Forged Attack 11</span>Battlefist Smash</h1><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><i>Channeling arcane power into your battlefist, you smash it into your enemy with such force that you leave your foe staggering.</i></p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\\\"images/bullet.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Requirement</b>: Your battlefist hand must be free.</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence vs. AC</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Hit</b>: 3[W] + Intelligence modifier damage, and you push the target a number of squares equal to your Constitution modifier.
