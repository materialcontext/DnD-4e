And we’re needy enough to be first in line!&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlord, trained in Stealth<br/><br/>Those who live outside the law are fiercely independent. Some are outcasts by nature, but most are driven to the fringes of society because a rigid authority denied them any other place. It’s not easy for free spirits to acknowledge their need for leadership. You understand that those who act alone are easier to hunt down. Outlaws must be inspired to band together for their common good. That’s where you come in.<br/><br/>Because of your charm and your bravado, and because you never give up, you’re the one they rely on for this inspiration. When times are good, you’re the one they trust to divvy up the loot. On the days when the law wins, it’s you who holds despair at bay and encourages your band to press on. You are a prince of knaves, and no matter what company you keep or how base you might be, none can deny that you have the dignity and magnetism of a born ruler.<br/><br/>A few heroes who follow this path truly are of noble birth. Legends abound with tales of deposed aristocrats toppled from the ruling class and forced to lead a ragtag band of rebels to recapture their rightful heritage. Others hope to use their blades and their wits to carve out a new throne for themselves. Whatever the past and the future hold for you, you know that you will triumph as long as you have your friends close—and a concealed knife even closer.<br/><br/><h3>PRINCE OF KNAVES  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Distracting Action (Prince of Knaves) (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, each ally you can see can shift his or her speed and make a Stealth check to become hidden as a free action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Generous Flanker (11th level)</b>: Any enemy you are flanking grants combat advantage.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lord of Scoundrels (16th level)</b>: Allies adjacent to you don’t grant combat advantage.<br/><p><h1 class=\\\"encounterpower\\\"><span class=\\\"level\\\">Prince of Knaves Attack 11</span>Clever Maneuver</h1><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><i>You attack your foe with a quick slash, then shove it toward one of your allies to finish off.</i></p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\\\"images/bullet.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. Reflex</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage, and you slide the target 3 squares.
