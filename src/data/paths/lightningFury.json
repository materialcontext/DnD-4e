    "text": "Your greatest joy is the fulfillment you attain through your stormy outbursts. Laughter rumbles from your mouth like thunder when you tear into foes with blinding bolts that scar the air and scorch the earth. Your form is cloaked in a shimmering haze of electric sparks and bolts that flash out to strike enemies that threaten you.<br/>When you defeat your foes, the fury in your blood subsides into quiescence, but it never moves too far beneath the surface. Even in your dreams as you rest, you can sense the thunderheads inside you roiling as they wait for the next storm to brew.",
