    "text": "You hate to be tied to any one location for too long; you’d rather be on the road, meeting new creatures and seeing new lands and nations. As a result, you feel at home nearly anywhere. This same ability also puts you in the good graces of people you meet along the way.<br/>Your inborn empathy and acquired diplomatic skill allow you to fit into nearly any society—if not as someone who has always lived there, then at least as a trusted friend. By understanding many kinds of people and creatures, you learn how to protect them—or fight them, if need be.<br/>When things turn rough, you can use your knowledge of other creatures to your advantage in a fight. The more foes that try to stop you, the better you can tangle their swords and spells, confounding their attempts to hurt you.",
