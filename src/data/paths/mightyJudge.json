    "text": "You are compelled to seek out and destroy those unworthies who thwart—by intent or by accident—the will of your patron. Your deity has tasked you to hunt down these infidels and see them brought to justice, and you do so with implacable zeal. You remain vigilant for signs of enemies of your faith. When you find them, you follow the will of your deity to the letter, bringing these foes to their knees. You tolerate no deviations from your course, whether brought about by others or by what some would call extenuating circumstances. Your half-orc heritage provides you with physical strength to handle those who might oppose your efforts to judge others as well as with mental fortitude to follow through on the task at hand.",
