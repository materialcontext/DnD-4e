    "text": "Although arcane finesse and delicate sword work are fine for others, you believe that better ways exist to subdue your enemies. You wonder why you should use subtlety when you can more quickly defeat your foe with a powerful sword strike combined with a blast of arcane energy.<br/>As a sword of assault, you are interested in fusing magic with blade to create the most powerful attack you can. You have little tolerance for rigorous arcane training, preferring to use magic in a blast of raw elemental energy instead of a carefully crafted spell.<br/>Similarly, you never saw the point of the refined swordplay of your counterparts, instead favoring strength over finesse. You believe that displaying your skill through elaborate parries and flourishes is an expression of a swordmaster’s ego, rather than of skill. In your mind, such displays only slow battle. On the other hand, you make sure that all of your movements and arcane utterances contribute to the most devastating attack you can possibly deliver with a single swing of your blade.",
