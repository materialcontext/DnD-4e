    "text": "The words of creation can bend the elements to your desires, but the words of mortal speech also have power to create or destroy. Far better to listen instead of speak, to seek the wisdom that comes with quiet understanding. You speak sparingly and softly, and you choose your words with great care. By husbanding the power of your voice for the words of creation, you ensure that your mind and soul are focused on the powerful prayers you utter.",
