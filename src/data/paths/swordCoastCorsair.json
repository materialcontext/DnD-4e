    "text": "The sea is an open road, and adventure calls to you from a dozen strange shores. You are always on the lookout for the next big prize or daring escapade. Whatever it might be—a lost hoard in a sea demon’s cave, a legendary shipwreck haunted by drowned ghosts, the fat treasure ship of a villainous merchant lord, or a misty isle wreathed in magic and mystery— you are determined to seek it out and test your cunning and courage against any obstacle in your path. You mean to blaze a path of fame or notoriety that they’ll be talking about a hundred years from now.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though you prowl the seas as a reckless freebooter and fierce predator, you are not necessarily a bloody-handed murderer. You would rather steal the ill-gotten gains of others than plunder the weak and poor. The Sea of Swords is dangerous enough without making yourself the enemy of all civilized folk, after all. It’s better to let honest folk pay for your protection. And if you can drive the truly murderous scum from the seas, then you’ll have less competition for the prizes that do catch your eye.",
