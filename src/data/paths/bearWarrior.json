    "text": "You revere the bear as a symbol of the warrior’s strength and prowess. Through long and ancient rites, you have bound that symbol to your heart with more than just words and totems. In battle, you become the bear, shaping your form to its form and your strength to its strength.<br/>Most bear warriors strive to emulate the bear beyond combat situations. You might catch fish with your bare hands, tear open beehives to feast on the honey inside, or roar in an aggressive territorial display. Like many barbarians, you’re more at home in the wild places of the world than when surrounded by buildings.",
