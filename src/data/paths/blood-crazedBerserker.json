    "text": "You have fought myriad battles, each a contest to determine who was strongest, who was most worthy of the champion’s mantle. You survived these battles through brute strength, speed, and toughness, but you always sensed something else, something truly monstrous, threatening to break free in the thick of battle. At one glorious point, your prowess grew mighty enough that the monster emerged. It burst through your self-control and transformed you into a raging killer. All finesse, planning, and moderation fell away. Only an unspeakable craving for blood and a terrible talent for producing it remained.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighters are distinguished by a mastery at arms and the rigorous control they apply in desperate situations. Every warrior must come to terms with anger in combat, to channel it in useful ways lest he or she become ruled by it. To fail is to wind up dead, skewered on an enemy weapon. Still, a few fighters surrender completely to their anger, girding themselves in hatred’s armor and powering their strikes with rampant ferocity.",
