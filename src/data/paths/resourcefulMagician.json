    "text": "Although arcanists might wield their power in different ways, all tap into the same source. By studying the techniques of other arcane classes, you discover commonalities between them all. Rather than seeing a wizardâ€™s esoteric formulas as obstacles, you learn ways around the complex mechanisms that allow you to duplicate their spells. Likewise, you find new ways to harness power in ways similar to sorcerers even though it does not well from within you. You can hurl fireballs, assemble magical servants, call forth dread magic from within, or siphon power from otherworldly beings all though the normal routines you perform with your bard spells. Armed with this new knowledge, nothing is beyond your capabilities. ",
