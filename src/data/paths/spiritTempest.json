    "text": "What is a spirit but an exhalation of the world, a distillation of life lived in the drawing and releasing of breath? The spirits of the world are alive, and that means they are in motion. They are a wind that blows through the world, even in the solid rock of the earthâ€™s deepest reaches.<br/>As a spirit tempest, you tap into the movement of the spirit world, the wind that blows through all things. You draw on that movement to bring motion to the field of battle: You call spirit winds to transport yourself and your allies in the blink of an eye, to carry your healing power and the power of your attacks into larger areas, and to empower the attacks of your allies.<br/>The spirits are the breath of the world. Breathe deeply, and let them move and guide you.",
