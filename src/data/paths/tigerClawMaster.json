    "text": "The tiger claw style is an ancient, honored path. Its practitioners have incorporated techniques from different traditions, but the style retains a central feature: the tiger claw. A practitioner curls his or her fingers toward the palm to make a claw. Through iron discipline, the monk transforms each digit into a rigid talon capable of raking and rending.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mastering tiger claw maneuvers builds your strength and hardiness, and your strikes shred enemies. You spring at your foes with astounding speed. With true mastery, you take on the characteristics of the celestial tiger. Coarse orange and white striped fur covers your body. Your hands become clawed paws and a tiger’s visage replaces your features. With great green orbs for eyes and a mouth filled with sharp teeth, you embody the tiger claw style.",
