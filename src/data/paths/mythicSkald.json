Warriors gather around fires to swap tales about the Great Bear and the World Serpent, while shamans whisper portents revealed to them by the Fate Weaver to any who will listen. Though such stories live large in those who revere the oral tradition of storytelling, they are not guarded, not secret, and any who would listen and learn from them can touch their great power.",
