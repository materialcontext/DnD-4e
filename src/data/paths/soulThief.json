    "text": "You are a soul thief, an assassin trained in a killing art created by the drow. To the drow, death is merely a release from the horrid torments they can inflict on the body and mind. Soul thieves learn shadow magic techniques that allow them to capture a creature’s spirit before it escapes to the afterlife. The soul suffers in agony within this state between life and death, its torment ending only when you use it to fuel your hexes.",
