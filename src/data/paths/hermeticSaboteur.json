    "text": "Few things please you more than creating nasty magical surprises for your foes. Although your traps are illusory, they are no less deadly to foes who stumble into them. As well, you love to add your own arcane flourishes to mundane traps, catching enemies off guard when they believed themselves safe. Admittedly, you might take unseemly glee in your phantasmal pyrotechnics. But wreaking havoc is so much fun!<br/>Still, you must not incur your companions’ wrath by scattering such deadly tricks too liberally, or putting them where they could be triggered by accident. So you are careful . . . as careful as a saboteur can be.",
