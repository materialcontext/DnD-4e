    "text": "Fey tricksters, gnomes, and storytellers of every race know many legends unfamiliar to other creatures—tales from secluded forests, burrows deep underground, the lairs of powerful beasts, and the locked vaults of powerful monarchs. And what they don’t know, they make up.<br/>As a cunning prevaricator, you traffic in the honored (at least among some) traditions of exaggeration, misdirection, and out-and-out lying. You study and follow the teachings of great fabulists of the past—all of them fictional, almost certainly—and apply that knowledge to your bardic skills. You transfer your natural talent for illusion and deception to your friends, granting them some small measure of glory—or so you try to convince them.",
