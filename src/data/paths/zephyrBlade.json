Can you grasp it in your hands? If not, you stand no chance of stopping me.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Battlemind<br/><br/>Without formal training, you learned your techniques in a haphazard fashion, unlocking your potential with each contest, awakening new techniques as you blended psionic power with your weapon strikes. At some point during your battles, you began to hear a faint wailing—subtle, quiet, but definitely present. Now when you fight, the breeze whips up into a storm, lending new strength to your attacks.<br/><br/>What you hear are psionic winds swirling around you. Your crude methods cause psionic power to bleed from you. Instead of dissipating, it swirls, blowing around you, unseen and unnoticed by any but you and the enemies who stand against you. When you reclaim this power, your body undergoes a strange transformation, becoming disjoined from reality for a moment or two before you snap back into place.<br/><br/>The more you work with this loosed psionic power, the more ephemeral you become. You can stir up the power to rip through your enemies’ minds, or you can draw it into yourself to vanish and reappear where least expected.<br/><br/><h3>ZEPHYR BLADE  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Beguiling Advantage (11th level)</b>: Your melee attacks against dazed, slowed, or stunned enemies deal extra damage to them equal to your Charisma modifier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b>: You gain 2 additional power points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Zephyr Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you are insubstantial and phasing until the start of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Speed of the Wind (16th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to speed.
