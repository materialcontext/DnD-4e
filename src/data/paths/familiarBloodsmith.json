    "text": "You are a master tinker and can create construct familiars of such perfection that they are scarcely distinguishable from living creatures. Essentially homunculi, your familiars incorporate a tiny portion of your own life energy, distilled into a drop of your blood. This life link allows you to feel your familiar’s pain and drives you to keep it safe and make it stronger. Others might think you strange because you spend so much time with your creations, but they don’t understand: These are your children. Your path features all relate to your familiar, and your powers work only if your familiar is in active mode. Since it’s important that your familiar stick around if you want to make full use of it, take some familiar feats to increase its defenses and to gain other benefits.",
