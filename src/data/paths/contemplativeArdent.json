    "text": "From the time you first felt another’s emotion, from the moment you experienced another’s thought, you have struggled against the flood that threatens to drown out your identity. It seemed you would never grow comfortable with your strange talent—and yet, against all odds, you did. You developed your concentration to drive back outside influences, but you still can’t remember the last time you were alone in your head.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training, focus, or natural adaptability has let you control the voices invading your thoughts. You can now single them out and use them to warn you of hidden dangers or to find ways around a foe’s defenses. In effect, your supernatural senses give you cues to leading and fighting in battle.",
