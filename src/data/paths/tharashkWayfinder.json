    "text": "Rangers in House Tharashk often become wayfinders, all-purpose guides who travel the world helping to resolve the house’s quarrels. A wayfinder is part scout, part bounty hunter, and part inquisitive. As a wayfinder, you might, over the course of a season, guide dragon shard prospectors through dangerous wilderness, capture a fugitive, uncover who’s smuggling poisons into the slums of Sharn, and even explore a dungeon or two along the way. Your dragonmark guides your attacks, whether you’re fighting hand-to-hand or with a bow. Once you determine your quarry, you are relentless in your pursuit of it. Those who flee from you find that there’s no escaping a wayfinder, only a delay of the inevitable.",
