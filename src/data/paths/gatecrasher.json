You might be negotiating with a fomorian king instead of a tiefling merchant or cracking open a portal instead of picking a padlock, yet the principles are the same. You make it your business to locate lost relics across the planes and to learn the whereabouts of creatures that donâ€™t want to be found. Your connections span hundreds of organizations and people, and you know the locations of scores of portals.",
