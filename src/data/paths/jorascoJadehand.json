    "text": "When Sahemi the Emissary told House Jorasco that it should help heal Eberron from the wounds of the Last War, you listened. Despite resistance from much of the house, Sahemi insisted that the dragon mark that he and his kin bore mandated an effort to help heal the land. A supporter of Sahemi’s efforts, you call yourself a jadehand for the jade bracelets you wear in emulation of the Emissary. You respect the druidic traditions, and you’re interested in stopping supernal menaces and healing the world’s scars, such as the Mournland. You have a broad view of what constitutes “healing,” so you also apply your skills liberally to help heal people and the land. For you, exposing a demonic cult and thwarting frontier banditry are just incisions and surgeries performed on a larger scale.",
