    "text": "Dragonborn can be a harsh and taciturn race. When a dragonborn becomes known for excessive jesting or practical jokes, he or she is shunned and called glee-born or “touched by copper.” Rather than accept scorn, glee-born embrace their fun-loving nature and welcome the title with pride, even if they are forced into exile away from dragonborn lands. Luckily, many human kings welcome glee-born into their courts as jesters or courtesans.",
