    "text": "To many, there is no clearer expression of the power of nature than the raging fury of the storm. Churning clouds, crashing thunder, and blasting lightning are manifestations of the rage coursing through the world when its natural laws are violated and its purity corrupted. When gods or primordials overstep their bounds, when demons or aberrant beings try to tear the fabric of reality, the fury of a storm—and its cleansing rain—are part of nature’s response.<br/>Most wardens draw power from the earth. As an incarnation of the storm’s wrath, your greatest primal power comes from the sky. Lightning flows in your veins, and thunder booms in your footsteps. As you advance along this path, you can transform yourself into wind and rain and can ultimately take on the aspect of storm’s wrath.",
