Its holy warriors are embroiled in an eternal war against demons, devils, lycanthropes, and undead. Foremost among the Silver Flame’s divine servants are the exorcists of the Silver Flame. These individuals travel the world, devoting their lives to deeds that exemplify the faith’s precepts.<br/>As an exorcist of the Silver Flame, you enjoy a powerful connection to the Silver Flame and have become a living vessel for the power that underpins the Church. The Voice of the Flame specifically selected you for this service, and it falls to you to uncover corruption and purge it from this world. You have hardened yourself against the grisly deeds you must perform to eliminate evil. You unleash the power of your faith upon your enemies, scorching them with flames that purify the iniquitous and bolster the righteous. Whenever you use your prayers, a small silver flame appears above your head to identify the holiness of your cause and the stature of your position within the Church.",
