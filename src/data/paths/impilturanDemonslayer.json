Your death-dealing abilities even grant your allies the power to circumvent a demon’s prodigious defenses. Your twin blades are the bane of demons, cutting a swath through their foul legions and purging their dark influence from your once-great kingdom.<br/><br/><h3>IMPILTURAN DEMONSLAYER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Demonslayer Blade (11th level)</b>: Your Hunter’s Quarry class feature deals 1d6 extra damage against demons.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also gain a +5 bonus to Arcana checks to discover knowledge about demons.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Demonslayer's Wrath (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, all enemies adjacent to you take a -1 penalty to AC until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For demons, this penalty is -2 instead of -1.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Demon's Misfortune (16th level)</b>: When you damage a demon, the demon loses all resistances until the end of your next turn.
