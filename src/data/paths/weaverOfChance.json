    "text": "You appreciate the cosmos for what it is: a senseless place where mad gods play, primordials cavort, and wizards can make their mark. You understand that the world and its echo planes are not the result of deliberate design but of uncounted eons of slow iteration.<br/>In a universe where gods control the fate of souls, weave the threads of destiny, and embody overarching principles, few find your philosophy reasonable. Some might even think you mad. But you have no illusions about ultimate meaning or purpose. If anything, your morality is purer: You perform acts of goodness not because you follow a code or seek some greater purpose, but because you choose to do so.",
