    "text": "Beneath the world of daylight lies a vast realm of eternal night—the caverns, tunnels, and vaults of the Underdark. This wilderness of stone is home to dangerous monsters and rapacious civilizations that plague the world, and it’s here you’re at home. You have explored the lightless passages and wandered the uncounted miles of labyrinthine caves. The bizarre ecology of this subterranean world is as familiar to you as the flora and fauna of a surface forest; you know how to survive where other heroes would find a cruel, swift death.",
