    "text": "You have been called different names—killer, murderer, assassin—but none fit as nicely as whisperknife does. You kill, but not for wealth and rarely for sport; you kill for vengeance. In a perfect world, everyone would die from old age, but this isn’t a perfect world. Accidents happen, and wars claim soldiers and innocents alike. Murderers snuff out lives on a whim or with cold calculation, and the world keeps on turning. Souls wriggle free from their meat to find whatever awaits them in the Raven Queen’s frigid embrace. And who stands for these victims? Who protects the people whom justice ignores? You.",
