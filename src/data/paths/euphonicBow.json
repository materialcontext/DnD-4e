    "text": "You intertwine music, archery, and magic into a single glorious craft that is as artistic as it is martial. Your foes waver between fear and admiration even as you draw a bead on them. Every shot from your bowstring resonates with a melodious tone, and the percussion of your arrows finding their marks drives the battle forward like a drumbeat. Even your foes’ cries of pain blend with the clash of weapons against shields and armor. Your arcane might weaves it all into a fantastic symphony of battle.<br/>Creating this wondrous performance depends partially on your ability to see an instant into the future. Timing is everything.",
