These are warrior societies that celebrate the dragonborn ideals of honorable combat and glorious victory, while celebrating what makes them dragonbornâ€”the dragon within that empowers their dragon breath. Each of these warrior clans has a patron dragon type, and the members of those societies typically emulate their patron dragons in a variety of ways, from alignment and behavior to the damage type of their dragon breath.",
