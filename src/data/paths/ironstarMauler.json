    "text": "You are a battle-tested master of the Ironstar combat style. You wield a mace or a flail as easily as a graceful elf duelist wields a rapier; in your hands, these cruel weapons are as light and quick as willow switches. You have spent countless hours attaining the necessary balance, concentration, and intuition to use these weapons effectively. With uncanny precision, you can crumple a shield, break a weapon-hand, shatter fangs, or crush a skull.",
