    "text": "You understand the true nature of stars, and your knowledge surpasses that of nearly all other creatures. You have studied all the standard texts of star pact warlocks. You found the interpretations contained within those tomes to be catastrophic if accepted as fact. Perhaps some stars are windows into the Far Realm, as many star pact warlocks claim. You suspect that many stars hold other secrets, though. Thus, you have forged a new set of beliefs.<br/>With your star charts, astrolabe, and viewing glass, you have determined the luminosity and motion of many stars. You have plumbed their colors, their sizes, and most important, the power they offer to a warlock. You understand the symbiosis of nature and magic that is embodied by the stars, and so you have twisted your pact into something different from those of your counterparts. You no longer fear the depths of the sky, for you are the master of the starry night.",

    "flavorText": "The stars are points of light burning beyond the world. Some believe them to be windows though which inimical creatures study our cosmos. In my view, thatâ€™s a parochial conception of stars, at best."
