For years you endured painful lessons, grueling conditioning, and the occasional lethal test of your skill until you became a killing machine. But despite everything that was done to you, your spirit remained free and unbroken. In time you left your owners’ slave pens behind and set out to find your own fortune beneath the crimson sun.<br/><br/>Perhaps you are truly free, the master of your own fate after years of cruel bondage. Maybe you remain enslaved, but as a successful battle slave, you possess almost all the rights and luxuries of a wealthy free citizen. Whether you are a warrior who calls no one master or a prized champion who is a slave in name only, you carry the harsh lessons of your upbringing. Now it is your choice whether to fight for gold, for glory, for love, or for hate, but regardless of your motivation, you cannot escape the simple fact that fighting is what you do best.<br/><br/><h3>MUL BATTLE SLAVE  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Battle Slave Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain a +4 bonus to melee basic attack rolls until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Pain Is Weakness (11th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws while bloodied.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Battle Experience (16th level)</b>: If you miss all targets when using an encounter attack power and you have no other encounter attack powers remaining, you do not expend that encounter attack power.<br/><p><h1 class=\\\"encounterpower\\\"><span class=\\\"level\\\">Mul Battle Slave Attack 11</span>Challenge of Blades</h1><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><i>You plunge into the fray with a strike at the legs of one foe, then shift and make a second strike at another foe.</i></p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\\\"images/bullet.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Primary Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Primary Attack</b>: Strength, Constitution, or Wisdom vs. AC</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier, Constitution modifier, or Wisdom modifier damage, and the target is slowed and marked by you until the end of your next turn.</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Effect</b>: You shift 2 squares and make a secondary attack.</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Secondary Target</b>: One creature other than the primary target</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Secondary Attack</b>: Strength, Constitution, or Wisdom vs. AC</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier, Constitution modifier, or Wisdom modifier damage, and the target is slowed and marked by you until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class=\\\"encounterpower\\\"><span class=\\\"level\\\">Mul Battle Slave Utility 12</span>Sudden Strength</h1><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><i>You exert all the power of your mighty frame.</i></p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Special</b>: You can use this power only on your turn.</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next turn, you gain a +5 power bonus to Strength checks and Athletics checks, and your successful attacks also push the target 1 square.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class=\\\"dailypower\\\"><span class=\\\"level\\\">Mul Battle Slave Attack 20</span>Made of Iron</h1><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><i>You shrug off attacks; pain only makes you stronger.</i></p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\\\"images/bullet.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Stance</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Effect</b>: You can assume the iron body stance.
