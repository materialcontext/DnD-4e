    "text": "In the early years of the world, the mightiest sorcerers were dragons, powerful spellcasters who used the elemental magic churning in their blood to create devastating spells that cemented their hold over vast empires. Even as recently as the dragonborn empire of Arkhosia, dragons were the exemplars of the draconic sorcerer’s path. In the present age, however, few dragons practice the art that their ancestors created.<br/>Your path follows in the ancient footsteps of the greatest sorcerers the world has ever known, drawing on the traditions preserved from Arkhosia’s dragon lords and the sorcerers before them, back almost to the beginning of the world. Wielding the same power as the dragons of old, you inure yourself to the dangers of battle, making your mere presence a threat to your foes as you wreathe yourself in flames or lightning, acid or poison, cold or thunder, according to the nature of the draconic magic in your blood.<br/>The dragons of old are alive in your soul, and their power is yours to command.",
