    "text": "The world contains few sources of wealth greater than a dragon’s hoard. While most consider it suicide to target a hoard for theft, some rogues consider these targets the ultimate challenge. You count yourself among these thrillseekers, “liberating” gold and magic items from the lairs of great dragons, and possibly leaving a dead dragon in your wake as well.",
