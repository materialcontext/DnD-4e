    "text": "Rumor and legend speak of horrifying Vistani curses. Few are willing to put these dark parables to the test. Threat of ill fortune or a wasting disease is enough to keep the Vistani safe from numerous threats. <br/>Folk do well to heed the folktales, because the stories are true. Of this fact you are living proof.<br/>Although many a Vistani knows the magic to place a lasting curse on someone who has offended the clan, you are something more. In an instant, with but a glare and an oath, you can turn fortune against your adversaries. Those who dare raise their hands against you soon see the folly of their actions.<br/>Any who show you the respect and camaraderie you deserve have little to fear. While standing beside you or watching your back, your allies benefit from the bad luck you hurl at your foes. They could even say that you bring  them good fortune instead of afflicting enemies. Despite the reality, with a sly Vistani smile, you might let them believe this is true.",
