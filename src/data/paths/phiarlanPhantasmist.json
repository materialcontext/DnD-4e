    "text": "The entertainers and artisans of House Phiarlan employ a variety of media and techniques to express their art and distract their foes. Members of the house who show a predisposition for illusion are often trained as phantasmists. As a phantasmist, you excel in evasion and deception. Your training has taught you how to bring your enemies’ nightmares to life. You can cloak yourself in shadows or trick foes with illusory forms. When you perfect your art, you even gain the power to make an illusion into a deadly reality.",
