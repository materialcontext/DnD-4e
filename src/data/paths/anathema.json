Instead, your knowledge of the underlying patterns in the structure of the objects and creatures that make up the world around you that allows you to test and sunder that structure.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raw stuff of life and matter are yours to toy with. Your power comes at a price, however. With each bond you break, the structure of reality is weakened to some small degree. Your work is minor compared to the ravages of time and the power of gods, immortals, and the Far Realm. But all things are connected, and your power might be the catalyst that unleashes destruction on the world.",
