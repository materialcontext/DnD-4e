It is merely the strong stealing from the weak, and while that might suit the odious scavengers that sup on dusty carrion in the deserts, it’s no way for people to live. They need someone to pull the veil from their eyes and break the bonds that restrict their thinking. Even the slaves need someone to show them they can be free. They need inspiration. They need an example—someone like an escaped slave.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are a rarity in Athas: You believe in freedom. You fight not just for yourself but for others. Anyone who seeks to escape the master’s whip deserves your help—as long as they don’t wish to turn the lash upon others. The slave masters, the corrupt nobles, the rich merchants, and the sorcerer-kings—they have the power, but slaves outnumber free people ten to one, and that means the odds are in freedom’s favor.",
