    "text": "A small faction of tieflings views the world through a veil of decay that shrouds the ugly and the beautiful alike with the appearance of death and rot. Some seek ways to minimize the influence of these visions on their lives. Other blightseers embrace the knowledge that the gaze of ruin grants them. They study the appearance of a thing as it is now and as it is in its ruined state, and over time they learn to read their visions for meanings about the present. The destruction they see serves as a constant source of omens about creatures’ fates and instructions on how to bring about those fates.",
