    "text": "Though no chains bind them, your enemies become your prisoners. You are a psionic binder, a living prison whose thoughts are as strong as adamantine bonds. When you engage your foes, you redirect their thoughts inward, forming mental walls to constrain their thoughts and root them to the spot. You can keep your enemy imprisoned long enough for your allies to close in and deliver whatever justice the foe deserves.",
