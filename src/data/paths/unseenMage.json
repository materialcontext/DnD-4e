    "text": "To see but go unseen, to affect the world but remain unaffected by it—this ability is at the heart of true magical power. Thus you have devoted yourself to the art of invisibility, rendering your body as transparent as a window without smear or blemish, through which no hint of your presence can be detected. You are an unseen mage; there is no stopping you. Or, more important, seeing you.<br/>Since you can vanish with great alacrity and facility, you must learn to watch your step to avoid being trampled by your own allies. Even walking invisibly in the street requires constant vigilance, lest some carriage or palanquin unknowingly run you down. And with such great power comes the potential for abuse, against which you must be vigilant.",
