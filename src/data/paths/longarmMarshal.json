    "text": "The spear and its cousins have existed almost as long as creation. It was the first weapon ever made, and it and its variants are still the most common arms in use. Simple spears are designed heavy for melee or light for throwing. A melee spear can be used with one hand or two. Specialized variations of the spear such as the longspear, the tratnyr, and various polearms were specifically designed for war. Such weapons provide a huge boon in the form of reach, allowing a wielder to strike from <br/>relative safety and to control the melee. Others, the tratnyr in particular, are multipurpose.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spears are the perfect weapon choice for smallunit commanders who like flexibility. Javelins and other thrown spears enable their wielders to loose volleys at a closing enemy, or make a viable option against a foe that prefers to stay at a distance. With a single spear, a warrior can choose to fight with a shield or without. Longspears and polearms allow an officer to contribute to combat while leading frombehind the front line, where the clash can be better observed and directed.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cognizant of the benefits of the spear, you chose to specialize in this multifaceted weapon. You trained to make long lunges and quick jabs with your weapon. A spearâ€™s haft is a defensive tool for you, and you have learned how to hedge in your foes or open deep wounds. Your skill is a blessing to your allies, who have seen that your mastery makes you a more reliable leader.",
