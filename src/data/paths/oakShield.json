    "text": "For centuries, the Oak Shields have guarded the wild areas of the world. Oak Shields, like their namesake trees, are known for longevity, hardiness, and loyalty. Legends claim that Melora personally trained the first members of the order, providing them with the secrets of using everspring groves and standing stones. Ancient sites such as these might hold information on how Melora’s faithful can benefit from them.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each aspiring Oak Shield studies under a master. Together, the student and the master meditate beneath a sacred oak, seeking enlightenment about the natural world. The student learns to interpret the whispers of the primal spirits and to understand the wisdom of the changing seasons. During this time, he or she comes to appreciate when to stand tall against the wind and when to bend when the wind is too strong. In addition, the student learns about the complexity of the world, how something as simple as a tree can have multiple aspects to its nature. An Oak Shield applies these lessons to his or her life’s work as a guardian of the natural order, remaining steadfast in the face of adversity and providing shelter during the storm.",
