Although Amaunator dropped the youthful mask he had worn for centuries, his experiences as the Dawn Lord shook him from his ancient mindset. Amaunator is still a dignified god of immense age, but he remembers his youth, and he encourages his followers to do the same.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Morninglord, you are the champion of your god’s youth. The optimistic spirit of Lathander guides you as you seek to master the chaos of the new world. The fires of your god burn within you and lend you the inexhaustible energy of youth. You are tireless, fierce, rebellious and full of hope. You shine like a beacon in the darkest hours of night, inspiring those around you to greatness they never dreamed possible.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To your enemies you are the searing sun itself, shedding scorching brilliance from your form. Evil is confronted by fiery annihilation in your wake, for though you walk with Lathander’s carefree spirit, your heart burns with the all-consuming fire of Amaunator.",
