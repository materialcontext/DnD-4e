    "text": "Many barbarians fight with the viciousness of a wild animal. Others draw strength from the violence of storms or the destructiveness of fire. You prefer a more steady source: the might of earth and stone. Although the earth endures in stillness, entire cities are destroyed when its anger is incited. You have studied the power of the earth and learned to incorporate it into your barbarian evocations. You combine the raging fury of magma with the patience of stone.",
