    "text": "You have earned the favor of the Winter Court and, perhaps, the Prince of Frost. The power of the Winter Fey flows through you, chilling your blood. At times, you can feel the presence of your bitter patron, watching the world through your eyes. This honor is dangerous. It means that your patron is well aware of your actions and the degree to which you are following the terms of your pact.<br/>Other lords of the Feywild can sense your bond to the Winter Court. If you attend the Court of Stars or negotiate with the archfey, you might be treated with the respect owed to a faithful vassal, but this can be a double-edged sword. Compared to other mortals, you are expected to be aware of the customs of the court and to follow these rules. Failure to do so reflects poorly on you and your patron.<br/>Your powers are tied to the primal force of winter. Your blood is cold in your veins, and you do not feel the bite of ice, snow, and bitter winds. Those who use cold against you will know what itâ€™s like to feel the touch of a frozen heart.",
