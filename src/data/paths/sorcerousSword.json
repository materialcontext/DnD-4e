This additional power can be the same level as another power you prepare, but this feature does not allow you to prepare the same power twice on the same day.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Choir of Swords (11th level)</b>: While your bladesong is active, you can spend an action point to make a melee basic attack against each enemy adjacent to you as a standard action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bladesong Ballet (12th level)</b>: While your bladesong is active, you can use a move action to shift a number of squares up to your speed.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bladespell Step (16th level)</b>: Once per encounter, you can teleport up to 5 squares as a free action immediately after you use a bladespell power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Signature Spell (20th level)</b>: You gain a wizard daily attack power of 19th level or lower.<br/><p class=\\\"publishedIn\\\">Published in <a href=\\\"http://anonym.to/?http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.php?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317290000\\\" target=\\\"_new\\\">Neverwinter Campaign Setting</a>, page(s) 77.</p>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    </form>\\r\\n</body>\\r\\n</html>\\r\\n\\r\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\">\\r\\n    if (document.all) {\\r\\n        if (document.documentMode != 9) {\\r\\n            var ar = document.getElementsByTagName('span'\\r\\n            for (var i = 0; i < ar.length; i++ ) {\\r\\n                var c = ar[i].attributes['class'].value;\\r\\n                if (c == 'milevel')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-24px\\\";\\r\\n                else if (c == 'miright')\\r\\n                    ar[i].style.top = \\\"-18px\\\";\\r\\n            }\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }\\r\\n</script>\\r\\n');\n",
