    "text": "Having embraced the dark side of divine magic, you are now ready to delve deeper into the forbidden, to fully embrace the power offered by the dark forces of the cosmos. Only those who have committed evil are invited to study these black arts. Through the filthy deeds you have done and the wickedness in your heart, you have proven yourself worthy.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dabbling in occult mysteries carries a heavy price in body, mind, and soul. To harness the magic these entities offer, you must carve your f lesh with blasphemies. To understand the rites, you must push your mind to madness’s brink. To prepare your soul, you must indulge in every evil, wallowing in the horror of it all.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where paladins fight for honor, good, and order, idols of darkness are treacherous, wicked, and capricious in their dealings. They kill for pleasure. They maim to learn from their victim’s suffering. They never hesitate to feed their ambition and to grow their temporal power—they know that beyond the mortal coil lies only annihilation.",
