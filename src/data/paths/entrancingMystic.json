    "text": "You are a figure of rumor and local folklore. You learned your craft from the First Order, ascended quickly to the Second Order, and made your pacts to the invisible magi of the Third Order. In return for your devotion, they have given you the power to beguile and warp minds.<br/>Your ways are mysterious and frightening to other creatures. When you use your spells, and even when you speak, people sit and listen, enraptured by the hypnotic sound of your words and mesmerized by your eyes. Few ever realize what they risk upon meeting your ensnaring gaze or listing to your enthralling voice. Those who do realize your true power consider themselves lucky to have survived the experience.",
