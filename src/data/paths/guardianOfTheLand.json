    "text": "There is no greater calling than to protect the land, to shelter it from those who would exploit it for the power it contains. Your long associations with the spirit world revealed to you the fragile balance that allows life to continue despite the hardships. Only if this balance is maintained can life and the world recover, and so you make this your work, devoting your life to its protection.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primal spirits are not blind to your sacrifice, and they respond to your efforts by lending aid where and when they can. Whenever you choose a land to guard, the spirits emerge from the broken landscape to add their strength to your own. They slow enemies as they approach and punish the trespassers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As your bond with the land grows, so too does your understanding of its power. You can draw primal magic into yourself when you assume bestial forms, growing your strength and vitality. Within your guarded sites you can move from place to place, ensuring that nothing under your stewardship comes to harm. And if you face a dire threat, you can call forth the ancient spirits to harry and kill any you name as your enemy.",
