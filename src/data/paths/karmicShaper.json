    "text": "Moral consequence is something all creatures face, whether they recognize its existence or not. The effects of each creature’s deeds influence the past, present, and future. You do not hold this view as a philosophical belief: It is demonstrably true.<br/>Each action a being takes is like planting a seed. Depending on the deed’s nature, harvesting its fruits might bring joy or pain. You seek to increase your own measure of joy in the world, while ensuring that your foes reap equivalent pain for their past misdeeds.<br/>You are an interpreter of karma. With your prescient sight, you can collect your foes’ karmic debt in a timely, sometimes dramatic fashion. On the other hand, your own actions touch only lightly on the karmic surface of cause and consequence. You shape the fates of others without unduly affecting your own final destiny.",
