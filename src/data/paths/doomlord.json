    "text": "From brooding fortresses in the Elemental Chaos, the Doomguard watches the decay of the cosmos and its unstoppable slide into dissolution. These stoic warriors believe the universe’s fate was sealed when the gods defeated the primordials, because imprisoning these entities kept them from sustaining the world and thus doomed it. The Doomlords are the Doomguard’s champions, warriors aligned against those who espouse order and perpetuate corrupt and tyrannical regimes. As is true of their cousins, the Doomguard Marauders (Manual of the Planes), the ranks of the Doomlords include both valiant champions of freedom and murderous anarchists.",
