    "text": "You are the guardian of two worlds. You know the perils of the wild, but you also know the corruption that dwells in the heart of civilization. Many wardens eschew civilization in favor of the purity of nature. Although you see the virtue in their point of view, you have chosen to straddle both realms in the hopes of keeping an eye on each. You know that if either becomes too dominant, neither can flourish. So you live and work, instructing people on how to interact with and be respectful of the forest, but also protecting them from deadly predators and harsh storms.",
