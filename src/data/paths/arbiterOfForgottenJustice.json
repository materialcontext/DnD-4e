Their crimes must be punished—from simple human greed to the murder of Amoth.<br/><br/><h3>ARBITER OF FORGOTTEN JUSTICE  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Retributive Action (11th level)</b>: You can spend an action point as an opportunity action when an ally within 20 squares of you becomes bloodied or drops to 0 hit points. When you do, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls until the end of your next turn, and you take a standard action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sliver of Justice (11th level)</b>: When you score a critical hit with a divine attack power, one ally of your choice within 10 squares of the target regains a number of hit points equal to 5 + your Wisdom modifier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Beacon of Justice (16th level)</b>: You can score critical hits with radiant attacks on a roll of 19–20. Against demons and devils, this range increases to 18–20.<br/><p><h1 class=\\\"encounterpower\\\"><span class=\\\"level\\\">Arbiter of Forgotten Justice Attack 11</span>Smiting Blades</h1><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><i>A burst of radiance not only chars your foe, but causes its steps to become unsteady.</i></p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\\\"images/bullet.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Radiant</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Area</b> burst 2 within 12</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. Fortitude</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Hit</b>: 1d10 + Wisdom modifier radiant damage.
