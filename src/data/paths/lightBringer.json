    "text": "The runes have long been a potent weapon for the gods, and few runes are as mighty as the twelve sigils of the sun. These runes embody concepts of hope, the coming dawn, protection, and endurance. You have studied them in hopes of mastering the divine magic they offer. Few can unlock these runes’ power, since they demand a heavy toll from those who study them. You spent hours staring into the sun, almost going blind in the process, to purge your mind of all shadow. Only in such a condition can a runepriest master these runes.",
