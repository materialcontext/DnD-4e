Your problem might have come from a life among savage and warlike  people, or you could just havea nasty temper. In either case, your time at the war college was brief when it was  clear the instructors had nothing to teach you. In your adventures since, you have learned to channel your wrath into your attacks. When you look back on the stodgy lessons and unbearable drills, you laugh because you have learned a better way to kill.",
