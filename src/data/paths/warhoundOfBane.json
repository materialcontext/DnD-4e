Some heroes volunteer their strength to this divine cause, but not you. Your training taught you how to wield a weapon, not a holy symbol, and to place your faith in your armor and your own courage. As a warrior of outstanding courage and skill, you have caught the attention of Bane, the god of war, and his heavy gaze lies upon your battles and quests.",
