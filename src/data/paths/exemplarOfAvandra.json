    "text": "The life of an adventurer is a life of extremes. Although you stare death (or worse) in the face on a regular basis while serving Avandra, you also embrace everything else life has to offer.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You find joy in sharing a hearty meal in the company of friends both old and new. You hunt and fish as needed and enjoy the world around you. You delight in journeying to a previously unknown land, whether the journey is safe and quick or filled with peril. When danger draws near or when those around you are in need, you don’t hesitate to spring into action, calling upon Avandra as your greatest ally. Regardless of the situation, you embrace life with unbridled confidence and optimism, and you accept the inevitable challenges you face with equanimity.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these joys fill your heart to brimming, and you praise Avandra for the opportunity to live an adventurous life filled with beauty and peril.",
