    "text": "The darkness of the Abyss is a deep wound in the center of the Elemental Chaos,a bleak vortex that births the planes’ myriad evils. Corruption flows out from this darkening pit to infect the land and creatures and twist them to evil. During your adventures, you encountered abyssal energy—perhaps when you slew a demon or after you explored a tainted site. The corruption changed you, infected you, and exposed you to horrid evil. Now it is all you can do to hold that evil at bay.",
