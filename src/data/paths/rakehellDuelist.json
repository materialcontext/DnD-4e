    "text": "You are a rakehell duelist because you’re the best at what you do. With a weapon in each hand, you rely on fast footwork and skillful parries. You scorn combatants who need half an hour to strap on heavy armor before they can do battle. By the time other warriors are ready, you can dispatch three sets of opponents and two flagons of ale. Knowing that a fight is around the corner, you make sure you’re prepared and that you enjoy life while you can.",
