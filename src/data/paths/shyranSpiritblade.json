    "text": "In the days of old Shyr, the practices of the swordmage were forbidden to all but the favored of the ruling primordial Karshimis. Many genasi, however, took to the wilds outside of civilization to learn their ancestral craft in secret. Deep in the wilds, some of these students found masters that had become sympathetic with the primal world, carrying on an ancient discipline that blended arcane prowess with primal resonance. You have carried on this tradition, calling your spirit ally to your mystic blade, resulting in a fighting style unknown to almost all others on Toril.<br/>You have an intense bond to both your blade and your spirit friend, such that both have become inseparable from you. You often act as an emissary between the wilds of the frontier and the learned halls of civilization, spending time in both worlds. Your balanced upbringing means others often rely upon you to be the source of stability when things go awry.",
