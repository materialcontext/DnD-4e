    "text": "Each generation leaves behind the ashes of the old, but the spirits of the past live on for those with the eyes to see them and the ears to hear them. You dwell in two worlds, opening your inner awareness to look upon death and tease out its secrets. You commune with these spirits, seeking out their advice and divining solutions to your troubles by solving their riddles. Their signs are everywhereâ€”even in the omens you see and the portents you dream.",
