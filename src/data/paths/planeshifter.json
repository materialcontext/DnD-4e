You can use that move action to teleport 10 squares.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Study of the Planes (11th level)</b>: You acquire and master the Planar Portal ritual, even if you do not have the Ritual Caster feat or are of the appropriate level. You gain a +4 bonus to Arcana checks when performing rituals that have the travel category.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Location Mastery (16th level)</b>: You and allies within 5 squares of you cannot be teleported against your will.<br/><p><h1 class=\\\"encounterpower\\\"><span class=\\\"level\\\">Planeshifter Attack 11</span>Sequester</h1><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><i>A vortex opens behind your foe, drawing it into a timeless demiplane and briefly trapping it there.</i></p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\\\"images/bullet.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Teleportation</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence or Charisma vs. Fortitude</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Hit</b>: The target is banished to a demiplane (save ends). The target disappears, cannot take actions, and cannot be targeted. On a save, the target reappears in the space it last occupied. If that space is occupied, the target returns to the nearest unoccupied space of its choice. You can expel the target from the demiplane as a free action, in which case it appears as described above.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class=\\\"encounterpower\\\"><span class=\\\"level\\\">Planeshifter Utility 12</span>Quick Portal</h1><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><i>No one can open a portal quicker than you.</i></p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\\\"images/bullet.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Teleportation</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 5</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Effect</b>: You create a portal in an unoccupied square within range that lasts until the end of your next turn. The portal leads to a permanent teleportation circle on your current plane. You must know the teleportation circle’s sigil sequence, and you lose three healing surges when you create the portal. If you have fewer than three healing surges when you use this power, you take damage equal to your healing surge value for each healing surge you don’t lose.</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Sustain Standard</b>: You lose a healing surge or take damage equal to your healing surge value when you sustain the portal.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class=\\\"dailypower\\\"><span class=\\\"level\\\">Planeshifter Attack 20</span>Dimensional Cascade</h1><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><i>You cast an enemy through a sequence of deadly planar locations.</i></p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\\\"images/bullet.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Teleportation</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 20</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=\\\"powerstat\\\"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence or Charisma vs. Will</p><p class=\\\"flavor\\\"><b>Hit</b>: The target is cast through a series of dangerous planar locations. Until the start of the target’s next turn, the target disappears, cannot take actions, and cannot be targeted. In addition, choose four damage types from the following list: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, and thunder. The target takes 4d8 damage (1d8 of each damage type in whatever order you choose), and the target takes ongoing 5 damage of each type (save ends all).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start of the target’s next turn, the target reappears in the space it last occupied.
