    "text": "Long communion with corrupted primal spirits left its mark on you and though you can still work unspoiled primal magic, much of who you are and what you can do is shadowed by the Elemental Chaos. The primordial plane has a hold on your body and soul, and you cannot so easily shrug off its touch. Now, in all that you do, its influence shines through in the flames dancing across your weapon and the earth trembling beneath your feet. Through sheer determination, you turn this dread power to your advantage.",
