She strode from a cave mouth, arrayed in the sea-green robes of an ancient prophet, and called herself the scion of the Sea Tyrant. “Behold!” she declared, revealing a vision of a terrible flood in which legions of angels were swept into eternal chaos. After showing you this disaster, the oracle bathed your eyes in water, and your vision was forever changed.<br/>Like the prophets of old, you are capable of gaining horrible insights into the future. In most cases, your predictions extend so far ahead in time that you can do little to affect the course of events. However, you sometimes predict imminent events, and in these cases, you can take steps to avert or fulfill the occurrences you foresaw.",
