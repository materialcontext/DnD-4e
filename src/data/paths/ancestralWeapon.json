According to the stories, these forebears were a breed apart: stronger, wiser, and more attuned to the virtues of the spirit way than the people of today are. The ancestors’ spirits do little to discourage such tales. It’s good to be remembered fondly and respectfully, so that young people will heed ancient lessons. Eventually, the young grow up and learn that people throughout history have largely been the same.",
