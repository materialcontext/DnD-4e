    "text": "You are a beacon in the darkness, one who reveals the way, and a guardian of the dead. Through your holy works, you ensure that the souls of the dead move on, free of fear and remorse, and unimpeded by sinister entities that would use them for dark deeds. You harbor a special hatred for undead, seeing them as perversions of the natural order.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visions of past lives—leftover fragments from those you have saved—haunt your dreams. Although the sights are unsettling, they renew your commitment to guard the souls from the dangers lurking between this world and the next.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you use your soul guide powers, ephemeral bits of soul materialize and swirl about you.",
