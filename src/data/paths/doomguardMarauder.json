    "text": "The Doomguard is a nihilistic society of mercenaries, marauders, and freebooters that troubles the domains of good and evil alike. As a member of the Doomguard, you believe the universe is sliding toward destruction and that everything eventually comes to an end. The best of the Doomguard are free-willed revolutionaries who fight to overthrow tyranny and stifling order; the worst are murderous villains who revel in destruction.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Doomguard Marauder, you possess the traits of an anarchist. Laws run counter to nature and deprive mortals of the freedom to choose their fate. For good or bad, the Doomguard is ever the enemies of tyranny and government. The societyâ€™s members especially hate devils, and they continuously wage war against them.",
