    "text": "When you take on the form of an insect swarm, the insects glow with supernatural light. The stories of your ancestors tell of luminescent insects in primeval times, insects that led your ancestors through swamps and forests to safety. These creatures had no kindness for the enemies of your tribe and used their hypnotic lights to lead enemies astray, drowning them in deep bogs and abandoning them in animal dens. You, too, are a protector and an ally when you take on the shape of the luminescent swarm.",
