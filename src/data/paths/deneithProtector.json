    "text": "Deneith’s protectors are among the most storied members of the house’s Defenders Guild, an organization of mercenary bodyguards who are combat veterans. As a protector, you protect your charge with both combat prowess and the supernatural powers of your dragon mark. Although most of your comrades are probably members of the Defenders Guild, you might also find yourself working with the Blademarks Guild—an organization of mercenaries who provide a variety of services throughout Khorvaire—and the Sentinel Marshals, a group that ensures the enforcement of law and order. Your training has honed your skills to protect others, and you relish the opportunity to thwart enemies who try to attack your charges. Those foolish enough to venture such an assault swiftly meet your weapon as you deliver retribution for their audacity.",
