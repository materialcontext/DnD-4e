This ancient shrine, located on a remote mountain peak that is said to straddle the boundary between the natural world and Bahamutâ€™s domain in Celestia, teaches a particular form of mysticism that is unique to dragonborn, for its goal is to be increasingly formed into the likeness of Bahamut himself.",
