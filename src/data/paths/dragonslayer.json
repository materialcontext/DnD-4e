They sport a daunting arsenal of claws, fangs, stings, roars, and breath weapons, and they are protected by iron-hard scales and supernatural vitality. Many also have a wicked, calculating intelligence. Few warriors stand a chance against such foes, but you have made it your duty to protect defenseless folk against their depredations. You seek out all destructive monsters—including other fantastic beasts such as manticores, wyverns, and sphinxes—and put an end to their reigns of terror.",
